See COPYING for the license 

This package contains the "build environment" for Meta-Environment packages.
  - Make rules
  - M4 macros for autoconf, pkg-config, and autobundle
  - Ant configuration

The goals are:
  - each package should have the same build interface
  - no duplication/cloning of m4 macros and make rules
  - hiding autoconf/automake ideosyncrasies as much as possible
  - having a single 'bill-of-material' file for each package that
    can be used by other tools (like sisyphys, pkg-config, autobundle, etc.)

Usage:
The script 'meta-build' must be run from the root of a package. This copies
the build environment files (or soft links) into the package. From that
moment on, the package is independent from the meta-build-env package.
The convention is to have a './reconf' script that calls 'meta-build'.

Files:
  - meta-build.m4: macros that extend autoconf to use pkg-config files
    to retrieve dependencies, and to set up a Java build environment, etc.
  - Makefile.top.meta: Makefile to include in all toplevel Makefile.am's of
    C-based packages
  - Makefile.java.meta: Makefile to include in all toplevel Makefile.am's of
    Java-based packages
  - Makefile.meta: Makefile to include in all other Makefile.am's.

Note that each package should have a file called <package>.pc.in that
declares the name and the version and other important stuff for a package.
