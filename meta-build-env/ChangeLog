 * meta-build.m4: added META_C_SETUP, common macro calls for
   C packages. Except that AC_PROG_LIBTOOL can not go in there because
   autoreconf scans for it in configure.ac to be able to call
   libtoolize if necessary.
 * meta-build.m4: added META_REQUIRE_SOFTWARE, a macro for adding
   dependencies on third-party packages, like graphviz.

 * meta-build.m4: 'Requires' field is comma separated, while we expected
   space separated. Fixed.
 * meta-build.m4: More use of tr to remove accidental newlines
   in data retrieved from pkg-config files.

 * meta-build.m4: the generated PACKAGE-uninstalled.pc where
   broken, since the LocalLibs and LocalCflags did not use the
   required colon syntax. I've tweaked the generator to uncomment
   lines from PACKAGE.pc that start with #uninstalled. Looks much
   better as well :)

   We'll probably need a mechanism to remove configuration lines as
   well (for tools), but that's a matter of coming up with some nice
   convention.

 * meta-build.m4: generates PACKAGE-uninstalled.pc.in file
   from PACKAGE.pc.in file using the LocalLibs and LocalCFlags 
   variables.

Thu Jul 20 01:45:22 CEST 2006 <martin.bravenboer@gmail.com>
 * meta-build.m4: added PACKAGE-uninstalled.pc to the
   AC_CONFIG_FILES. This introduces the requirement for all packages
   to include this file.

 * meta-build.m4: improved the META_GET_PKG_VARIABLE macro to deal
   with multiple pkg-config files in the same directory. It now picks
   only the first one. Maybe this should even be improved further,
   since stuff might break if the uninstalled package is first in the
   list (which would be very strange).

Thu Jul 20 09:40:23 CEST 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * meta-build.m4: calls META_REQUIRE_PACKAGE automatically using the
   Requires variables from the pc.in file.
 * meta-build.m4: builds up a EXTERNAL_JARS file to be used in the
   setting of ClassPath. This requires each .pc.in file that needs
   to export a classpath to set a variable:
      ExternalJars=@EXTERNAL_JARS@

Wed Jul 19 11:18:07 CEST 2006 <{jurgenv,storm}@cwi.nl>
 * meta-build.m4: call to AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE uses information from
   <package>.pc.in from now on, instead of from 'package'. This makes
   the package files redundant.
 * meta-build.m4: factored out the esyscmd call into a macro, such
   that we can extract any variable from a <package>.pc.in file.
 * meta-build.m4: changed :blank: to :space: in the call to esyscmd,
   such that we can remove the wrapping `printf ` call.
 * Makefile.am,meta-build.src,meta-build.xml: renamed meta-build.xml
   to meta-build.ant
 * Makefile.*.meta: removed use and generation of autobundle 'package' file

Wed Jul 19 09:50:13 CEST 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * meta-build.m4: added a $ to dereference META_FOUND_PREFIX instead
   of putting the variable name itself in it.

Wed Jul 19 01:18:49 CEST 2006 <martin.bravenboer@gmail.com>
  * meta-build.m4: Fix in the determination of the filename for the
    .pc in AC_CONFIG_FILES. Strange that this worked at all ...

    Directories of --with-pkg arguments are now placed in front of the
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH. This can deal with a bit more usual installation
    scenario's.

    Major fix in the check on the found prefix of packages. Of course,
    comparing paths by string comparison is a very bad idea, for
    example /foo will not be equal to /foo/ and also symbolic links
    are not supported. The check now fetches the actual prefix from
    the .pc file in the given prefix itself and compares that value to
    the found prefix. This check had to be disabled for bundles.

    Fix in the reporting of prefixes if the value was not explicitly
    specified.

 * meta-build.m4: 
   Added a new macro META_BUNDLE_PKG_CONFIG_PATH, which is invoked
   from META_SETUP. This macro handles the --with-bundled-packages
   argument of autobundle and extends the PKG_CONFIG_PATH with the
   top-level directories of the packages that are available in the
   bundle. In this way, the uninstalled packages can be found by
   pkg-config.

   Basic bundling now works, though there was one minor problem with
   the way autobundle passes the prefix to the subpackages. This
   still needs to be resolved.

 * package: a package for the standard (really!) build environment of
   all meta-environment packages, including C, Java, ToolBus
   and ASF+SDF stuff. This package will not depend on anything
   but standard GNU stuff like M4, autoconf, automake, libtool.
   One can see it as an extension to the auto* GNU tools.
