  * meta-build.m4: Fix in the determination of the filename for the
    .pc in AC_CONFIG_FILES. Strange that this worked at all ...

    Directories of --with-pkg arguments are now placed in front of the
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH. This can deal with a bit more usual installation
    scenario's.

    Major fix in the check on the found prefix of packages. Of course,
    comparing paths by string comparison is a very bad idea, for
    example /foo will not be equal to /foo/ and also symbolic links
    are not supported. The check now fetches the actual prefix from
    the .pc file in the given prefix itself and compares that value to
    the found prefix. This check had to be disabled for bundles.

    Fix in the reporting of prefixes if the value was not explicitly
    specified.

 * meta-build.m4: 
   Added a new macro META_BUNDLE_PKG_CONFIG_PATH, which is invoked
   from META_SETUP. This macro handles the --with-bundled-packages
   argument of autobundle and extends the PKG_CONFIG_PATH with the
   top-level directories of the packages that are available in the
   bundle. In this way, the uninstalled packages can be found by
   pkg-config.

   Basic bundling now works, though there was one minor problem with
   the way autobundle passes the prefix to the subpackages. This
   still needs to be resolved.

 * package: a package for the standard (really!) build environment of
   all meta-environment packages, including C, Java, ToolBus
   and ASF+SDF stuff. This package will not depend on anything
   but standard GNU stuff like M4, autoconf, automake, libtool.
   One can see it as an extension to the auto* GNU tools.
