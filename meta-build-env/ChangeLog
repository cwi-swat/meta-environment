	* meta-build.m4: There now is a META_GENERATE_ECLIPSE_PLUGIN_FILES_FOR_C target that is used to generate Eclipse meta data for C packages.

Tue Apr 29 17:14:41 2008    <bruntink@cwi.nl>

	* meta-build.m4: The Require-Bundle part of MANIFEST.MF is split
	  over multiple lines to prevent generating a line that would be
	  too long.

Mon Apr 28 15:50:13 CEST 2008 <{jurgenv,bruntink}@cwi.nl>
 * meta-build.m4: fixed generation of MANIFEST.MF using line continuations
   such that Eclipse does not complain about lines that are too long

Fri Apr 25 15:42:01 CEST 2008 <{jurgenv,bruntink}@cwi.nl>
 * meta-build.m4: added generation of .settings directory and contents for
   default Eclipse settings (like source compliance level)

Fri Apr 03 11:43:54 CEST 2008 <lankamp@cwi.nl>
 * Modified the gentifs stuff to work with the updated version.

Thu Mar 27 11:41:30 CEST 2008 <lankamp@cwi.nl>
 * We now check if a .project file is present or not before generating it.
 This prevents peoples personal configuration from getting messed up when they
 run the configure script.

Wed Mar 26 11:48:15 CEST 2008 <lankamp@cwi.nl>
 * Added workaround for the "ERROR: files left in build directory after
 distclean" problem, so distcheck stops complaining. .project, .classpath,
 build.properties and META-INF/MANIFEST.MF are now being ignored.
 * Fixed a problem in meta-build.ant. The build, dist and doc directories were
 being created in the wrong place (the project prefix was being appended).

Thu Mar 20 16:42:14 EDT 2008 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * meta-build.m4: use of LOCAL_JARS to fill .classpath entries

Thu Mar 20 15:38:22 EDT 2008 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * meta-build.m4: added PACKAGE_ALL_DEPS variable which contains the
   transitive dependencies of the current package without double entries.
 * meta-build.m4: added generation of META-INF/MANIFEST.MF,
   build.properties, .project and .classpath files when META_JAVA_SETUP is 
   called.  This makes proper Eclipse plugin bundles from every Java-based 
   package we have, based on the information in the .pc.in files.
   It's a step towards a seemless integration of our Java code into Eclipse.

Mon Feb 25 13:17:41 EST 2008 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * meta-build.ant: Added LOCAL_JARS and EXTERNAL_JARS to class path 
   of check target.

Fri Jan 18 12:00:00 CEST 2008 <lankamp@cwi.nl>
 * meta-build.ant: The resources are now being packaged into the JAR files
 again.

Sat Jan  5 13:13:09 EST 2008 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Makefile.java.meta,meta-build.ant: allow building jars outside maintainer-
   mode, and made distcheck target working too.

Fri Nov 30 11:51:19 CEST 2007 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * Makefile.java.meta: allow building jars outside maintainer-mode

Thu Sep 27 11:15:00 CEST 2007 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * Makefile.meta: EXTRA_DIST and CLEANFILES not only for maintainer mode
   anymore fixes distdir and distclean problems on MacOS X.

Mon Aug 20 17:52:23 CEST 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Makefile.meta: changed EXTRA_DIST in maintainer mode for generation
   of ToolBus interface code. In some cases the interface code is not
   necessary (for example when compiling an ASF+SDF ToolBus tool). The
   extra dist would ask for a .c file for every .idef file, which would
   not be there. Fixed this by changing the wildcard to add every 
   *.[ch] file to EXTRA_DIST regardless.

Mon Aug 13 19:04:25 CEST 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * meta-build.m4: added { } curly's around generated dereferences of
   long shell variable names. This fixes "Bad string" warnings by autoconf
   on Solaris 10.

Mon Aug  6 11:28:02 CEST 2007 <{storm,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
 * Makefile.meta: Changed make rules of generation of c files from idef
   files. The current rules did not work always in distribution that were
   not compiled in maintainer-mode. This depended on what the timestamps
   of the generated source files where. 
 * Makefile.meta: in non-maintainer-mode many generated files are in the 
   distribution. They get copied to the build directory in this case, but
   not cleaned. The distcheck-clean target fails because of this. We can not
   add the files to CLEANFILES, because then 'make clean' would throw them
   away leaving the user nothing but to unpack the distribution again. We
   found a fix in the automake manual, which will not demand removal of
   all generated files anymore when doing distclean-check in 
   non-maintainer-mode.

Thu Aug  2 16:19:02 CEST 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Makefile.meta: The 'which' command on SunOs and MacOS X does not
   have a return value unequal to 0 when the command is not found. 
   There is no portable alternative command to which which does the job.
   So, I've implemented a rudimentary for loop that checks whether a command
   is to be found in any of the paths in ${PATH}.

Sun Jun 10 09:12:25 CEST 2007 <jong@metamud.org>
 * README: corrected some typos

Wed May  2 12:35:58 CEST 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * meta-build.m4: removed "function" keyword from shell function
   definitions to see if we can get meta-build.m4 more 'sh'-compliant.

Thu Apr  5 14:11:50 CEST 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Makefile.java.meta: removed inclusion of Makefile.meta in
   Makefile.java.meta. This is essential for separating automatic make rules
   for generation of ToolBus interfaces for different programming languages.


Tue Mar 27 19:11:49 CEST 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Makefile.meta: added checking for ToolBus bootstrapping utils, and using 
  touch if not available. This requires that all generated files are 
  stored in the version repository. 

Tue Mar 27 10:46:40 CEST 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Makefile.meta: added automatic rules for ToolBus interface generation,
   starting from a .isrc file, which is transformed to a .idef file by
   substituying __PREFIX__, and ending with a .c and .h file that implement
   the bridge for C. Add blabla.idef to your _SOURCES variable to use it.
   Example:
   bin_PROGRAMS=foo
   foo_SOURCES=main.c foo.idef
   Make sure not the let foo.idef have the same basename as another source
   file, since the rules compute foo.o and link it into the program.

Thu Feb 15 14:52:40 CET 2007 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * meta-projectSet.psf: Add Eclipse team environment

Mon Sep 25 17:19:34 CEST 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Makefile.top.meta: if the including Makefile.am defines the
   EXTRA_DOC variable, then this variable defines the dependencies
   of the 'doc' target, otherwise doxygen will be used to generate
   documentation.

Wed Aug  9 19:31:18 CEST 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Makefile.rules: added definitions of generic make rules for
   ToolBus, Apigen and ASF. In progress, and will be merged with
   Makefile.meta as soon as it is working.

Wed Aug  9 09:23:23 CEST 2006 <{kooiker,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
 * meta-build.m4: META_IF_CONTAINS used ' ' quotes which prevented
   substitution of variables.

Tue Aug  8 15:25:16 CEST 2006 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * meta-build.m4: fixed processing of PkgConfigPath by translating : into
   space

Mon Jul 31 13:39:18 CEST 2006 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * meta-build.m4: fixed passing paramater to META_IF_CONTAINS in 
   meta_recursive_requires

Mon Jul 31 12:55:44 CEST 2006 <{kooiker,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
 * meta-build.m4: added META_IF_CONTAINS, which replaces the old
   'grep -q' hack (not portable), with a different implementation
   that should be portable using test and expr.
 * meta-build.m4: transitively closed PKG_CONFIG_PATH is stored
   in the installed .pc file, and used to construct a PKG_CONFIG_PATH
   BEFORE using pkg-config. This solves the problem of using
   pkg-config while every package is installed in a different prefix.

Fri Jul 28 15:15:46 CEST 2006 <{kooiker,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
 * meta-build-m4: fixed nasty bugs. If a package name is a prefix
   of another package name, the grep trick does not work. The
   workaround is to add a space " " to the end of the regular
   expression. This works, but it ain't pretty.

Fri Jul 28 11:53:45 CEST 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * meta-build-m4: refactored META_INSPECT_PACKAGE to
   call META_INSPECT_PACKAGE_JAVA and added call to
   META_INSPECT_PACKAGE_TOOLBUS.
 

Fri Jul 28 04:49:07 CEST 2006  <martin.bravenboer@gmail.com>
  * meta-build.m4: major refactoring of the macros, after
  discovering a few nasty bugs.

  -----------------------------------------------------
  1) previously, the basic structure of META_SETUP was:

  for each Dep
    check for --with option
    extend the pkg-config path
    find the Dep with pkg-config
    inspect the Dep for all kinds of variables
  end

  This breaks if Requires are not a topological sort and the packages
  are not installed at the same prefix. Example: error-support
  requires toolbuslib. Assume the line Requires: error-support
  toolbuslib. On inspecting error-support, the possible --with
  option for toolbuslib has not been handled yet, which might cause
  a failure in finding toolbuslib, which is a dependency of
  error-support. Worse, it might load an incorrect toolbuslib.

  The solution is to split the for loop, and make sure that the
  PKG_CONFIG_PATH is completely ok before starting checking the
  packages.

  Another advantage of this pkg-config will check every dependency
  itself before we starting messing with searching and grepping
  pkg-config files.

  So, where the old approach was:

  for each Dep
    META_ARG_WITH_PACKAGE(Dep)
    META_CHECK_PACKAGE(Dep)
    META_INSPECT_PACKAGE(Dep)
  end

  The new approach is:

  for each Dep
    META_ARG_WITH_PACKAGE(Dep)
  end

  for each Dep	
    META_CHECK_PACKAGE(Dep)
  end

  for each Dep	
    META_INSPECT_PACKAGE(Dep)
  end

  This is what the new macro META_REQUIRE_PACKAGES does.

  -----------------------------------------------------
  2) The transitive requires closure took pkg-config files from the
  prefix, which is incompatible with uninstalled
  packages. Pkg-config does not allow us the get the pkg-config file
  for a given package name (too bad), so we have to reimplement this
  searching. For this, I've added a function that walks the
  PKG_CONFIG_PATH to look for -uninstalled and installed pkg-config
  files.

  For debugging and clearity, the closure is now also reported.

  -----------------------------------------------------

  Other fixes:
  - the transitive closure functions are now a bit more hygienic by
  declaring variables as local. For example, using a non-local
  variable PREFIX is quite dangerous.
  - added some more documentation to all the macros.
  - improved reporting to the user at several places.
	

Fri Jul 28 02:21:27 CEST 2006 <martin.bravenboer@gmail.com>
 * meta-build.m4: implemented support for uninstalled jars. The
   variables are documented in meta-build.m4. A copy:

   PACKAGE_JARS: JARS to use at build time.
   PACKAGE_INSTALLED_JARS: JARS to use after installation.

   EXTERNAL_JARS: JARS to use at build time.
   EXTERNAL_INSTALLED_JARS: JARS to use after installation.

 * meta-build.m4: dropped the AC_SUBST of JAVA_EXTERNAL_JARS. It is
   kind of confusing, considering that we already substitute
   EXTERNAL_JARS.

 * Makefile.java.meta: improved the handling of local jars. Of
   course, always passing a -lib option will break if JAVA_LOCAL_JARS
   is empty. JAVA_LOCAL_JARS is now in a foreach.

Thu Jul 27 14:25:38 CEST 2006 <{jurgenv,kooiker}@cwi.nl,martin.bravenboer@gmail.com>
 * meta-build.ant: changed default target from Java 1.4 to Java 1.5
 * meta-build.m4: changed implementation of construction of CLASSPATH.
   Every Java package now declares both a JarFile and Jars. Jars says
   where the Jars of this package are installed. JarFile says which jar to
   build from the source code of this package.

Wed Jul 27 09:57:01 CEST 2006 <{storm,kooiker,martinrw}@cwi.nl>
 * Makefile.am: removed stale pkg-requires target.

Wed Jul 27 09:53:01 CEST 2006 <{storm,kooiker,martinrw}@cwi.nl>
 * meta-build.m4: removed incorrect call of AC_REQUIRE.

Wed Jul 27 09:49:01 CEST 2006 <{storm,kooiker,martinrw}@cwi.nl>
 * reverted previous changes.
	
Wed Jul 26 16:54:01 CEST 2006 <{storm,kooiker,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
 * configure, reconf, Makefile.src: build interface of meta-build-env now
   does not depend on auto-tools anymore; instead it installs them
   itself. This is implemented using a fake ./configure script which
   instantiates a Makefile that mimics standard automake Makefile
   targets. Make install will download autoconf, automake, libtool and
   pkg-config and install them in the prefix passed to the fake ./configure
   script.

Wed Jul 26 14:57:01 CEST 2006 <{storm,kooiker,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
 * meta-build.m4: added AC_REQUIRE for PKG_CONFIG and m4_allow'd patterns 
   _PKG_ERRORS.

Wed Jul 26 10:45:01 CEST 2006 <{storm,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * meta-build.m4: in macro META_REQUIRE_SOFTWARE finding a dependency's
   prefix by executing a program in a path resulted in _PREFIX variables
   containing the path of the executable instead of the prefix proper.

Tue Jul 25 22:39:01 CEST 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * pkg-requires.src: a script that prints the reflexive and
   transitive requirements of a pkg-config package.

Tue Jul 25 20:19:22 CEST 2006 <martin.bravenboer@gmail.com>
  * meta-build.m4: META_JAVA_SETUP: ExternalJars is subsituted, so
    we cannot get it from the pkg-config file. For now, the value of
    JAVA_EXTERNAL_JARS is the variable EXTERNAL_JARS, which has been
    determined earlier.

    However, I'm afraid we'll have to revise the use of ExternalJars
    completely. The essential reason why building against uninstalled
    packages works with pkg-config is that a package should only list
    *its own* properties in a pkg-config file. The ExternalJars is a
    property of a required package, which breaks. So, a package should
    only list the jars that it provides and the required packages. If
    the closure needs to be determined, then this should be done by a
    configure script (meta-build.m4). The  result of that closure
    should not be stored in a pkg-config file.

Tue Jul 25 15:58:43 CEST 2006 <{jurgenv,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * meta-build.m4: added META_C_SETUP, common macro calls for
   C packages. Except that AC_PROG_LIBTOOL can not go in there because
   autoreconf scans for it in configure.ac to be able to call
   libtoolize if necessary.
 * meta-build.m4: added META_REQUIRE_SOFTWARE, a macro for adding
   dependencies on third-party packages, like graphviz.

Mon Jul 24 10:55:42 CEST 2006 <{jurgenv,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * meta-build.m4: 'Requires' field is comma separated, while we expected
   space separated. Fixed.
 * meta-build.m4: More use of tr to remove accidental newlines
   in data retrieved from pkg-config files.

Thu Jul 20 16:54:24 CEST 2006 <martin.bravenboer@gmail.com>
 * meta-build.m4: the generated PACKAGE-uninstalled.pc where
   broken, since the LocalLibs and LocalCflags did not use the
   required colon syntax. I've tweaked the generator to uncomment
   lines from PACKAGE.pc that start with #uninstalled. Looks much
   better as well :)

   We'll probably need a mechanism to remove configuration lines as
   well (for tools), but that's a matter of coming up with some nice
   convention.

Thu Jul 20 13:16:05 CEST 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * meta-build.m4: generates PACKAGE-uninstalled.pc.in file
   from PACKAGE.pc.in file using the LocalLibs and LocalCFlags 
   variables.

Thu Jul 20 01:45:22 CEST 2006 <martin.bravenboer@gmail.com>
 * meta-build.m4: added PACKAGE-uninstalled.pc to the
   AC_CONFIG_FILES. This introduces the requirement for all packages
   to include this file.

 * meta-build.m4: improved the META_GET_PKG_VARIABLE macro to deal
   with multiple pkg-config files in the same directory. It now picks
   only the first one. Maybe this should even be improved further,
   since stuff might break if the uninstalled package is first in the
   list (which would be very strange).

Thu Jul 20 09:40:23 CEST 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * meta-build.m4: calls META_REQUIRE_PACKAGE automatically using the
   Requires variables from the pc.in file.
 * meta-build.m4: builds up a EXTERNAL_JARS file to be used in the
   setting of ClassPath. This requires each .pc.in file that needs
   to export a classpath to set a variable:
      ExternalJars=@EXTERNAL_JARS@

Wed Jul 19 11:18:07 CEST 2006 <{jurgenv,storm}@cwi.nl>
 * meta-build.m4: call to AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE uses information from
   <package>.pc.in from now on, instead of from 'package'. This makes
   the package files redundant.
 * meta-build.m4: factored out the esyscmd call into a macro, such
   that we can extract any variable from a <package>.pc.in file.
 * meta-build.m4: changed :blank: to :space: in the call to esyscmd,
   such that we can remove the wrapping `printf ` call.
 * Makefile.am,meta-build.src,meta-build.xml: renamed meta-build.xml
   to meta-build.ant
 * Makefile.*.meta: removed use and generation of autobundle 'package' file

Wed Jul 19 09:50:13 CEST 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * meta-build.m4: added a $ to dereference META_FOUND_PREFIX instead
   of putting the variable name itself in it.

Wed Jul 19 01:18:49 CEST 2006 <martin.bravenboer@gmail.com>
  * meta-build.m4: Fix in the determination of the filename for the
    .pc in AC_CONFIG_FILES. Strange that this worked at all ...

    Directories of --with-pkg arguments are now placed in front of the
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH. This can deal with a bit more usual installation
    scenario's.

    Major fix in the check on the found prefix of packages. Of course,
    comparing paths by string comparison is a very bad idea, for
    example /foo will not be equal to /foo/ and also symbolic links
    are not supported. The check now fetches the actual prefix from
    the .pc file in the given prefix itself and compares that value to
    the found prefix. This check had to be disabled for bundles.

    Fix in the reporting of prefixes if the value was not explicitly
    specified.
	
Tue Jul 18 22:56:29 CEST 2006 <martin.bravenboer@gmail.com>
 * meta-build.m4: 
   Added a new macro META_BUNDLE_PKG_CONFIG_PATH, which is invoked
   from META_SETUP. This macro handles the --with-bundled-packages
   argument of autobundle and extends the PKG_CONFIG_PATH with the
   top-level directories of the packages that are available in the
   bundle. In this way, the uninstalled packages can be found by
   pkg-config.

   Basic bundling now works, though there was one minor problem with
   the way autobundle passes the prefix to the subpackages. This
   still needs to be resolved.

Tue Jul 18 10:53:01 CEST 2006 <{kooiker,jurgenv}@cwi.nl,martin.bravenboer@gmail.com>
 * package: a package for the standard (really!) build environment of
   all meta-environment packages, including C, Java, ToolBus
   and ASF+SDF stuff. This package will not depend on anything
   but standard GNU stuff like M4, autoconf, automake, libtool.
   One can see it as an extension to the auto* GNU tools.
