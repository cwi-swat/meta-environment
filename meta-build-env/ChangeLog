	* Added a new macro META_BUNDLE_PKG_CONFIG_PATH, which is invoked
	from META_SETUP. This macro handles the --with-bundled-packages
	argument of autobundle and extends the PKG_CONFIG_PATH with the
	top-level directories of the packages that are available in the
	bundle. In this way, the uninstalled packages can be found by
	pkg-config.

	Basic bundling now works, though there was one minor problem with
	the way autobundle passes the prefix to the subpackages. This
	still needs to be resolved.

 * a package for the standard (really!) build environment of
   all meta-environment packages, including C, Java, ToolBus
   and ASF+SDF stuff. This package will not depend on anything
   but standard GNU stuff like M4, autoconf, automake, libtool.
