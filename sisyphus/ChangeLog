2006-12-15    <storm@cwi.nl>

	* src/roll.rb (Roll::CommandlineParser::self.parse): added a
	commandline option --pretend (-P) that prints out commands instead
	of executing them; this is useful for generating scripts.

	* Fix: boot_roll wasn't invoked properly by roll when bootrollrc
	is out of date. 

2006-12-14    <storm@cwi.nl>

	* src/utils/options.rb (Utils::Sisyphus::SisyphusClientCommandlineParser::self.parse): 
	Commandline option --COMMAND_LINE cmd should be returned as cmd --COMMAND_LINE cmd.

	* src/model/db.rb (Model::DBStore::last_item_for_target): an
	exception was raised that should only be thown on direct calls of
	latest_item. last_item_for_target should just return nil.

	* Feature: added action(-name) field to to si_result table.

	* Fix: sometimes stale build items weren't removed properly, thus
	causing a primary key constraint violation in the database. This
	caused apps to never build again. Stale build items are now *always*
	removed before it is determined whether a build is needed or not.

2006-10-06    <storm@cwi.nl>

	* Fix: the busy bit of hosts (in DB) is only set to true when
	actually building something (not when an iteration is started).

2006-10-05    <storm@cwi.nl>

	* Feature during builder's sleep, sending signal USR1 will restart
	the build cycle immediately.

	* Fixed transitive dependency derivation in script contexts.

2006-08-01    <storm@cwi.nl>

	* Feature: implemented "simple" backtracking. This means that if
	dependencies have failed for a target, older dependencies are
	used. This prevents too many "not trieds" in Sisyphus.

2006-07-28    <{storm,kooiker}@cwi.nl>

	* Feature: roll now supports an options -D that can be used in
	combination with -p to only build a packages and its (transitive)
	dependencies. 

2006-07-27    <storm@cwi.nl>

	* Feature: Sisyphus now support multiple build-env-packages that
	will be implicit dependencies to all packages. NB: the order of
	specification in profiles is significant: it is interpreted as the
	topological order on the dependency relations *inbetween*
	build-env packages. This means dat in the case of two build
	environment packages [a,b], a will be put in the path when
	building b but not vice versa.

	* Feature: the Maintainers field is now read from .pc.in fields
	and used for emailing (failed) build results. If a certain builder
	should send email, specify the commandline -m.

	* Feature: added --force option; forces a package to be built
	regardless of the builds stored in the database. 

2006-07-26    <kooiker@cwi.nl>

	* Fix: use _PREFIX in Makefile.am 

2006-07-20    <storm@cwi.nl>

	* Fix: a change in the implicit dependency build-environment
	package would not trigger a build of everything, as it
	should. This is now fixed.

2006-07-19    <storm@cwi.nl>

	* Feature: profiles can now have an entry build-env: <package>
	which indicates that <package> is an implicit dependency for all
	packages that will be built. When this package has been installed
	the path to its bin-directory is added to the environment that is
	used to build subsequent packages.

2006-06-28    <storm@cwi.nl>

	* Added RDoc documentation generation.

2006-03-21    <storm@cwi.nl>

	* Bumped to 0.32

	* Feature: transitive deps (tr_deps) are now available in
	templates

	* Feature: client now reloads if ruby files are changed.
	

2006-03-20    <storm@cwi.nl>

	
	* Feature: if a script (e.g. templates) are found in the profile,
	those are taken, otherwise the global script is used.

	* Bumped to 0.31

	* Fix: there appeared to be \0 bytes in changelogs which cause
	PostgreSQL to crash. They are now replaced by spaces.

	* Feature: preliminary support for making binary
	distributions. Disabled by default.

	* Feature: added options to roll for building the "current"
	package; an option to ignore action errors and options to make
	--above and --below exclusive.

	* Fix: there was a bug in --before/after. The time string was
	parsed at startup time instead of iteration

	* Fix: copying of backups filled up /tmp. No only one copy per pkg
	is saved.

2006-03-10    <storm@cwi.nl>

	* Bumped to 0.30.

	* Fix: config checkouts are now removed after finishing an
	iteration.

	* Feature: roll tool to perform builds on the commandline.

2006-03-08    <storm@cwi.nl>

	* Bumped to 0.29

	* Fix: mail was sent when nothing happened. Now mail is sent when
	there are one more failures.

2006-03-07    <storm@cwi.nl>

	* Bumped to 0.28

	* Feature: only do iterations on certain days of the week between
	certain times. Example: --weekday Wed --after 17:00 --before
	00:00. NB: --weekday must be specified multiple times if builds
	must occur on more days.

	* Feature: clients can now send email; specify mail addresses on
	command line with --mail. Config: --smtp smtp.cwi.nl:25. And
	--from <address>.
	

2006-02-17    <storm@cwi.nl>

	* Bumped 0.27

	* Feature: source distributions now use build-ids in versions.

2006-02-08    <storm@cwi.nl>

	* Bumped to 0.26.

	* Fix: Stale build items are now handled correctly
	
	* Fix: progress wasn't set to false when an build is not tried. 


2006-02-06    <storm@cwi.nl>

	* Bumped to 0.25

	* Fixed generation of source distributions for bundling. The
	versions in directory names in distributions (e.g. aterm-2.4) must
	correspond with the versions in the tar-ball name. 

	* Bumped to 0.24.

	* Feature: bundleable tar balls are now produced in a public
	download directory of Web of Sisyphus. A client only does this if
	  distributes: true
	  source_dist_dir: /path
	  collect_url: http://url
	is added to its profile (NB: path and url should point to the same
	location). 
	
2006-02-03    <storm@cwi.nl>

	* Bumped to 0.23.

	* Fixed another reason for crashing after each cylce; was: closing
	stderr.

2006-02-02    <storm@cwi.nl>

	* Bumped to 0.22

	* Fixed not storing of dependencies in the database.
	
	* Fixed crashing after each cycle (appeared only porter and
	batatrom); was: writing to a closed file.

2006-01-27    <storm@cwi.nl>

	* Bumped to 0.21

	* Added column to si_results table to be able to view build
	activitity before finishing.

	* Added saving log files to /tmp *per* build so that (some)
	history is retained. Specified by -q (quiet) on the commandline.

2006-01-20    <storm@cwi.nl>

	* Bumped to 0.20.

	* Fixed tentatively the fact that some builds may not be tried
	when they actually should have been. The fix is that there was a
	mistake about in how database queries were ordered (asc or desc).

2006-01-11    <storm@cwi.nl>

	* Bumped to 0.19.

	* Fixed not closing of opened tempfiles when capturing output from
	shell commands that are running.

	* Fixed duplicate key violation due to the fact that build items
	are stored after results are stored...

	* Bumped to 0.18.

	* Added more and more informative logging to the console.

	* Fixed duplicate dependency extraction; this resulted in
	duplicate key violations in the database.

2006-01-09    <storm@cwi.nl>

	* Bumped to 0.17.

2006-01-09    <{jong,storm}@cwi.nl>

	* Fixed arbitrary deadlocking emerging from the use of open4. Now
	simple temporary files are used when executing shell commands.

2006-01-06    <storm@cwi.nl>

	* Bumped to 0.16

	* Fixed double slash problem in install data hook; this didn't
	work on cygwin. 

2006-01-04    <storm@cwi.nl>

	* Renamed errors field in database to error_output because Rails does
	not like it (i.e. uses it for a special purpose).

	* Bumped to 0.15

	* Added fields for errors and environment to the si_result
	table. One can now see what really is executed for a build action.

	* Bumped to 0.14.

	* Fixed the fact that shell commands (build actions) weren't
	executed in isolated shells. Now every command is executed in
	environment that is explicitly declared in the profile. Commands
	that Sisyphus itselfs executes (e.g. svn and cvs) are executed in
	an environment determined by ./configure.

2006-01-03    <storm@cwi.nl>

	* Bumped to version 0.13.

	* Reverted change of building builds that are "in_progress"
	because of a crash; this had the effect that every package was 
	always rebuilt.

	* Fixed empty environment evaluation when build commands are executed. 
	This resulted in sh syntax errors.

	* Fixed single quote problem in script/Makefile.am
	

2006-01-02    <storm@cwi.nl>

	* Fixed passing of RUBYLIB environment variable to gem commando in
	Makefile.am

	* Fixed bug in environment handling in profiles. An empty environment
	is now valid and doesn't raise an exception.

2005-12-21    <storm@cwi.nl>

	* Refactored execute in env to not use waitpid myself. 
	* Stale build results (in progress) because of a crash are now
	rebuild	 

	* Finally the environment entry from the profile is executed in
	the same shell as the build commands are. It should be used to
	make builds isolated; i.e. set the path to appropriate
	identifiable compilers etc.

Tue Dec 20 17:08:40 CET 2005	<{storm,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
  * Version is 0.8 now
  * Started a ChangeLog ;-)
  * distcheck target runs smoothly now
