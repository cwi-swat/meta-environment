Todo
* Make deployment easier.
* Let builds start when sisyphus has changed (the uber dependency).
* Add support for branches
* Continue building using older integration on failure of dependencies
* Make robust against network outages
* Separate database hassle out of dependency logic 
   (use Visitors transforming a dependency graph of revisions)
* Use an extended profile which contains script and externals
   It should contain a hostname too (and the builder checks it is
   on the right machine). This would simplify the DB enormously
   at the cost of having a lot of similar profile files.
* Do something about the world version in profile.
* Separate errors field from stdout field in si_results table
* Do a chmod -R g+w to be able to remove checkouts etc.
* Add support for "on wednesday only" kind of "intervals"
* Separate database in two parts: one monotonely growing, the other editable.
* Make it work without the database.
