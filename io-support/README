SDF2 parser generator


Installation Instructions
=========================

1) Required packages.

   The parser generator requires the following packages:

   -GNU make, available from:
       www.gnu.org

   See the file ./package for the dependencies of pgen.

   Before building the parser generator, you should first install these
   packages.

2) Configuring the parser generator.

   Assuming that all dependencies are available in your PATH variable,
   and that the parser generator should be installed in <pgen> then the 
   following command will configure pgen accordingly:

   ./configure --prefix=<pgen>

   Note. Default behaviour of configure is that it will look for libraries
         in <prefix>/lib and for executables in your search paths. So,
         you do not need to specify the locations of all dependencies
         explicitly.

   If you use gcc, pgen is built with "gcc -Wall -g -O2". If you prefer
   different options use --with-cflags="<options>" when you run configure.

   ./configure --help gives a detailed list of configuration options.       

3) Building the parser generator.

   Assuming that GNU make is called "gmake" on your system then the
   following commands will build and install the parser generator:

   gmake
   gmake install

4) Checking the parser generator.

   The parser generator can be tested via:

   gmake check
