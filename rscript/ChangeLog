 * include make_rules so pkg file can be generated

 * Added a generic mapping from parse trees to RSTORE. The parse trees
   must contain pos-info. After using the lift-to-tree builtin, it extracts:
      a) which trees there are
      b) which lists there are
      c) which trees are children of which trees/lists
      d) which trees have which constructor names
      e) which trees have which types (only simple cf non-terminals supported)
   The user must import the parameterized BasicFactExtraction module
   with the top sort of the tree she wants to extract facts from and
   call the 'extract-basic-facts' function.

 * Brought RscriptChecker up-to-date with changes in Error api
 * Compiled specifications are configured for rewriting with annotations
   in make_rules.

 * Added basic/AreaOperations and basic/LocationOperations as imports
   to MyArea to be up-to-date with latest asf-library.

Tue Jan 20 16:57:03 CET 2004 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * remove MyPosInfo as its contents are in the asf-library now
 * remove access functions from MyArea that are in the asf-library

Tue Jan  6 13:08:00 CET 2004 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * Bag[[Elem]] and BagIterator[[Elem]] are now context-free start-symbols
   (fixes another warning)
 * export sort <Elem, Elem> which is needed for exported add-tuple production
 * retracted exporting of sort <Elem, Elem>: I didn't realize this was renamed
   to Tuple (and Tuple is now an Elem-list) and Tuple is already exported by
   Relations.sdf
 * fix deprecated use of unquoted symbol "export-pair" by adding quotes

Mon Jan  5 14:52:57 CET 2004 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * ChangeLog added
 * {Bags, ExtendedIntegers, Relations, RscriptElem, Rstore}.asf:
   upgraded condition syntax
