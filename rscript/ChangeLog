 * Bag[[Elem]] and BagIterator[[Elem]] are now context-free start-symbols
   (fixes another warning)
 * export sort <Elem, Elem> which is needed for exported add-tuple production
 * retracted exporting of sort <Elem, Elem>: I didn't realize this was renamed
   to Tuple (and Tuple is now an Elem-list) and Tuple is already exported by
   Relations.sdf
 * fix deprecated use of unquoted symbol "export-pair" by adding quotes
