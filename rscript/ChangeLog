 * spec/languages/rscript/run/RscriptCalculator.sdf: fixed bug in Rscript
   interpreter where declaration of variables in rstores results in empty
   variables.
	
Thu May 22 14:46:02 CEST 2008 <basten@cwi.nl>
 * util/rscript.sh.src: Fixed command line rscript interpreter.
 * Added dependency to error-support

Tue Sep 18 11:44:57 CEST 2007 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * tbscripts: Removed
 * bin/test: Added TestSuite

2007-08-27    <storm@cwi.nl>
 * spec/languages/rscript/check/Rscript.sdf: fixed a bug in the
 checker. User defined tuple types weren't checked properly. 

Thu Aug 23 10:31:25 CEST 2007 <{kooiker,jurgenv,lankamp}@cwi.nl>
 * bin/run/*.isrc: added possibility to kill a running interpreter.

Tue Aug 14 10:21:46 CEST 2007 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * bin/checker: Add checker binary with ToolBus support

2007-07-31    <storm@cwi.nl>
 * rscripts/tests3.rscript
   A test rscript for testing user defined function evaluation.

2007-07-31    <storm@cwi.nl>
 * spec/languages/rscript/{check,run}/*
   - Fixed evaluation of user-defined functions
   - Removed REXPTYPE IdCon -> REXPTYPE and replaced with
     a sort "Formal" (this is used for tuple fields and
     function arguments)
   - adapted checker/evaluator to deal with this
   - NB: a type <int, int foo> is not allowed anymore   

Thu Mar  8 14:13:38 CET 2007 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * spec/languages/rscript/run/Sets-and-Relations.{asf,sdf}:
   - promoted to asf-library/containers module

Thu Mar  1 11:28:12 CET 2007 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * Merged rscript-migration branch

Mon Jul 31 13:53:00 CEST 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * utils/Makefile.am: reactivated without testing 
 * demo/*: removed Java specific stuff and put it into 
   the new package java-source-analysis. This code will not
   work, but we keep it anyway in that package for future reference.

Thu Mar  9 15:38:10 CET 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * *: working on making relation-calculus an ASF+SDF library that can
   be included in the distribution:
     - tbscripts: contains .tb scripts and configuration files for the
       Meta-Environment. This replaces the old button scripts.
     - spec: contains the implementation of RScript, which will be 
       made available as a separate ASF+SDF library in the GUI
 * Currently, no tools are compiled or generated anymore. 
 * rviz: is currently disabled too
 * TODO: fix generation and compilation of commandline tools

Tue Oct 11 11:56:00 CEST 2005 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Bumped version to 0.3 (since 0.1 and 0.2 have been released
   previously for a Software Evolution lab).
 * rscript.sh.src could not deal anymore with a commandline where
   an initial RSTORE was NOT provided. Adapted the logic to
   accomodate.

2004-10-27  Paul Klint  <paulk@heelal.lan>
 * spec/RscriptCalculator.asf: added += and -= operators

2004-10-27  Paul Klint  <paulk@heelal.lan>
 * Cleanup up definitions of Bags and Relations
 * Removed typos from manual

Thu Oct 14 08:56:14 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Added spec/TopologicalSort.{asf,sdf}. 

2004-10-13  Paul Klint  <paulk@heelal.lan>
 * Undone change to diff operator
 * Added a built-in "unique" that transforms a bag to a set
 * Redefined "top" and "bottom" using the unique function
 * Updated the documentation
 * Added test cases
 * Most examples are running again.
	
Tue Oct 12 11:00:41 CEST 2004 <{kooiker,storm}@cwi.nl>
 * Difference operator on bags now removes all righthand 
   side elements (and not just one).
	
Fri Jul  9 14:08:06 CEST 2004 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * include make_rules so pkg file can be generated

Thu Jul  8 23:04:23 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Added a generic mapping from parse trees to RSTORE. The parse trees
   must contain pos-info. After using the lift-to-tree builtin, it extracts:
      a) which trees there are
      b) which lists there are
      c) which trees are children of which trees/lists
      d) which trees have which constructor names
      e) which trees have which types (only simple cf non-terminals supported)
   The user must import the parameterized BasicFactExtraction module
   with the top sort of the tree she wants to extract facts from and
   call the 'extract-basic-facts' function.

Thu Apr 29 11:15:45 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl,paulk@cwi.nl>
 * Brought RscriptChecker up-to-date with changes in Error api
 * Compiled specifications are configured for rewriting with annotations
   in make_rules.

Thu Apr 29 10:22:37 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Added basic/AreaOperations and basic/LocationOperations as imports
   to MyArea to be up-to-date with latest asf-library.

Tue Jan 20 16:57:03 CET 2004 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * remove MyPosInfo as its contents are in the asf-library now
 * remove access functions from MyArea that are in the asf-library

Tue Jan  6 13:08:00 CET 2004 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * Bag[[Elem]] and BagIterator[[Elem]] are now context-free start-symbols
   (fixes another warning)
 * export sort <Elem, Elem> which is needed for exported add-tuple production
 * retracted exporting of sort <Elem, Elem>: I didn't realize this was renamed
   to Tuple (and Tuple is now an Elem-list) and Tuple is already exported by
   Relations.sdf
 * fix deprecated use of unquoted symbol "export-pair" by adding quotes

Mon Jan  5 14:52:57 CET 2004 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * ChangeLog added
 * {Bags, ExtendedIntegers, Relations, RscriptElem, Rstore}.asf:
   upgraded condition syntax
