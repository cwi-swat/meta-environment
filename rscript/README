This is work in progress on the use of relations for program analysis.

Bags		the Bag datatype
Relations	the relation datatype
RScript		the syntax of the scripting language
RelationalCalculator
		evaluator for RScript

PicoExtraction	extract facts from a Pico program
UndefinedQuery	example query

Running an example:
1.	meta -m Pico-syntax
2.	open term pico1.trm
3.	parse it
4.	push Actions/Undefined Vars
(a list a messaged is displayed in a Message list)
5.	click on one of the messages
(the corresponding variable is highligted in the text of pico1.trm)


CAVEATS:

(1) For reasons I do not understand precisely, the hidden imports
    of asf/syntax/Comments do not work perfectly;
    Effect: from PicoExtraction and higher, comments in the
    equations lead to ambiguitites.

(2) The interpreter of Rscripts is **VERY** unfriendly; it is hard
    to pinpoint errors in your query.
