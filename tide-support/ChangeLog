 * tide-support.pc.in: Bumped version to 1.3

Fri May  9 11:27:11 2008    <bruntink@cwi.nl>
  * lib/debug-adapter.{c,h}: Added to repository because it cannot
    be generated without the toolbus.

  * lib/*: this directory was broken after adaptations to Makefile.meta wrt use of tifstoc
  Fixed this by renaming debug-adapter.c to debug-tool.c and adapter.isrc to debug-adapter.isrc

 * Added workaround for the queued ToolBus event problem. When sending an
 event one should wait for the acknowledgement before continueing, to prevent
 events from being send on the wrong socket in toolbuslib.

 * configure.in:
   - add libtool support

Fri Nov 19 16:42:38 CET 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Bumped to 1.1

 * Split tide/lib-c off into a separate package tide-support. The reason
   is that we don't want all tools to depend on tide (including its Java
   dependency). Examples are pgen, sglr, etc.
