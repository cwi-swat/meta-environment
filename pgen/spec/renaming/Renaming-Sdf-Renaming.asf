%% A renaming $\rho_2$ applied to a renaming $\rho_1$ $(\rho_1)\rho_2$ denotes
%% the composition of the renamings, i.e., $(x)(\rho_1)\rho_2 = ((x)\rho_1)\rho_2$.
%% This can be expressed by means of a single
%% renaming by renaming the targets of $\rho_1$ with $\rho_2$ and adding
%% $\rho_2$ at the end of the list of renamings.
