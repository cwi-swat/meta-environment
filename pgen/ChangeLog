Tue May  3 15:29:20 CEST 2005 <markvdb@cwi.nl>
 * Fixed a problem with respect to converting sorts into strings.

Tue Apr 12 17:05:18 CEST 2005 <markvdb@cwi.nl>
 * Regenerated bootstrap grammar in order to incorporate
   the new prefix function syntax.

Mon Feb 28 16:34:22 CET 2005 <{jurgenv,markvdb}@cwi.nl>

Wed Jan 26 11:25:22 CET 2005 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * SGLR now produces structured lexicals because of changes in the 
   flattener, also literals are no longer mapped to lit(<str>) trees.
 * Structured lexicals in ASF, means a reimplementation of some of 
   the functionality in the SDF normalizer. Nothing big though.
 * Regression tests succeeed without ANY changes.
 * Bootstrapped SDF2 normalizer and the Sdf2.baf parsetable
 * TODO: reimplement and regenerate SDF-checker!!!!! (sdf2table is now broken)

Wed Dec 29 08:58:03 CET 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Refactored SDF2 syntax definition:
   - ATerm syntax now uses StrCon and IdCon for literals
   - SDF2 does not reuse ATerm literals, but uses StrCon and IdCon
     where appropriate (such as in labels, prefix functions).
   - Unquoted literal symbols are syntactically disallowed from now on!
   - Introduced new non-terminal: ATermAttribute, such that associativity
     and other attributes (avoid, reject, bracket, prefer)
     can be rejected from it. Nested occurrences (inside an ATerm attribute)
     are now possible.
 * Changed Sdf2-Normalization accordingly: 
   - Quoting literals is not needed anymore.
   - Normalization of literals simplified.

     - removed: "cons" "(" term:ATerm ")"  -> Attribute 
                "constructor"              -> Attribute 
                "memo"                     -> Attribute
