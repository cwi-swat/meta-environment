 * Improved pgen efficiency and regenerated parsetables

2001/07/20 ({markvdb,jong,olivierp}@cwi.nl)
 * Switched to new parsetable format
 * Introduced character classes instead of aterm lists in order
   to enable future optimizations.
 * regenerated parsetables.

2001/07/18 (markvdb@cwi.nl, jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Fixed a bug with respect to the renaming of labelled symbols.
 * Regenerated normalizer with new compiler, the performance gain
   is significant.

2001/07/17 (jong@cwi.nl)
 * version 1.0 released, bumped to 1.1

2001/07/12 (jong@cwi.nl)
 * patched Makefile.am's to comply with new location of -lATB

2001/07/12 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Added the transitive closure calculation on chain prios.
 * Generated new reference table for the regression tests.

2001/07/11 ({markvdb,olivierp}@cwi.nl)
 * Moved priority uniqueness calculation from spec to c phase
 * Removed reachability analysis from spec

2001/06/07 (markvdb@cwi.nl) 
 * Bumped version to 1.0!
 * Removed C code generated by old compiler.
 * Added C code generated by new compiler. 
 * Adapted flatten code (for LookAheads) and flattenProd replaced by function
   from sdf-support library.
 * Normalization functionality moved to parsetablegen (activitated via "-n").
 * Adapted scripts in order to deal with -n.

2001/04/07 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * removed the function filter-attributes which was used
   to "propagate" avoid and prefer over generated injection chains.

2001/05/30
 * Fixed a bug with respect to the Symbol Int+ construction, the
   normalizer still used the old notation {Symbol}Int+.
 * Generated new C code.

 * Added -m to normalizer.
 * Regenerated some checks due to next point.
 * Context-free functions defined in priority section are no
   longer promoted to ordinary syntax section. Thus it is no
   longer possible to define a (context-free) function by giving
   only the priority declaration.
 * Version number increased to 0.8!

2001/03/15 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Small bug removed in normalizer which causes r[[LAYOUT]] to occur
   as a non normalized term.
