 * sdfchecker is now "Renaming compliant".
 
2002/03/25 (vandenbr@cwi.nl)
 * Added -s switch to sdf2table to call the sdfchecker.

2002/03/22 (vandenbr@cwi.nl)
 * Improved the handling of aliased symbols.

2002/03/22 (vandenbr@cwi.nl)
 * Added a simple check in the completeness of the definition.
 * Moved the Sdf part of the sdf-checker from meta to pgen.

2002/03/13 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Fixed another bug in the normalizer. When user-defined lexical
   syntax produces a character class a cyclic injection was introduced.
   For example: "foo" -> [a-z], introduced [a-z] -> [a-z] which is
   a degenerated injection from lex to cf.
 * Fixed a bug in the parsetable generator. User defined productions into
   character classes were ignored at generation time.

2002/03/05 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Fixed a bug in the normalizer. Two equations:
   [0] <cc -VAR> = cc
   [0] <L  -VAR> = L
   ruined the syntax generated for lexical variables,
   I removed them.

2002/03/04 (vandenbr@loria.fr)

   context-free/lexical restrictions.

2001/12/13 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Bumped version of parsetablegen to 4.2
 * Added asf-support library linkage (needed for normalizer spec).
 * Added --with-asf-support

2001/11/29 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Adapted the normalizer such that in the attributes of productions 
   ATerm functions are no longer quoted automatically.
 * Bootstrapped the normalizer and the sdf2 table after that.
 * Regenerated regression tests.
 * Bumped version of parsetablegen to 4.1

2001/11/25 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)

2001/11/23 (vandenbr@loria.fr)
 * fixed a bug: the character classes for lexical
   definitions with the same rhs symbol where not merged.
   [a-z]    -> Id
   [a-zA-Z] -> Id
   yields ambiguities.
 * Deactivated this bug fix, left the code in the specification.

2001/11/13 (jong@cwi.nl)

 * Bumped version of parsetablegen to 3.1
 * Bumped version of sdf2table to 1.11

2001/09/27 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Made some important changes in the SDF grammar:
     - added:   ATerm                      -> Attribute 
     - removed: "cons" "(" term:ATerm ")"  -> Attribute 
                "constructor"              -> Attribute 
                "memo"                     -> Attribute 
                "traverse"                 -> Attribute 
     - refactored the ATerm grammar a bit
 * NOTE: These changes affect any tool using SDF or AsFix[2,me].
 * Any ATerm can be an attribute now.
 * Bootstrapped the Sdf2.baf parsetable and the normalizer for the new SDF 
   grammar and the corresponding AsFix attribute format. See the ChangeLog
   of pt-support for details.
 * Due to the changes in SDF, several changes in AsFix have been made as well.
   See the pt-support package for details. Parsetables generated with the new
   SDF/AsFix have not changed, only the format of the productions is 
   slightly changed.
