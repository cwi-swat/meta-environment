Mon May 11 11:21:23 CEST 2009 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * src/Makefile.am,generate.c,etc: added generator functions to library
   interface. Made some headers files install into prefix/include.

Thu May  7 15:24:57 CEST 2009 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * src/Makefile.am: added libsdftablegen which includes the generator
   without the normalizer.

Wed Nov  5 13:01:57 CET 2008 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * src/Sdf2-Load.c: added support for parameterized modules using
   patch from Jeroen Arnoldus.

Fri Oct 31 15:25:24 CET 2008 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * src/Sdf2-Load.c: reverted previous change to SAF because embedded
   parse table in compiled spec is still BAF.

Fri Oct  3 09:35:02 CEST 2008 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Bumped to 2.8.1

Fri Sep  5 10:32:56 CEST 2008 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * src/Sdf2-Load.c: this file was empty for some reason, breaking the
   module loading facilities. Fixed by regenerating.
 * test/*: added special test for loading functionality which is also
   a good test for the ASF parse_bytes builtin.
 * pgen.pc.in: Bumped version to 2.8

Mon Jun  9 13:30:33 CEST 2008 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * pgen.pc.in: Bumped to version 2.6.1

Thu Jan 24 11:23:03 CET 2008 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Removed the svnmerge-integrated property that was left over from a branch 
   merge.

Thu Jan 10 16:18:26 CET 2008 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/*: collected some more statistics.

Thu Jan 10 11:20:58 CET 2008 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/main.c: corrected function call of options initialization.

Wed Jan  9 18:53:09 CET 2008 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/pgenOptions.{c,h}: rewrote some get options functions to macros and 
   added the stats filename value. Added PGEN prefix to avoid global variable
   naming conflict with global variables in SGLR.
 * src/parseTable-stats.{c,h}: rewrote to use macros. It is the same design as
   the SGLR statistics logging.
 * Added the PGEN_COLLECT_STATISTICS evironment variable. This needs to be set
   if statistics are to be collected.

Thu Dec 20 03:23:17 CET 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/Sdf2-Load.c: regenerated to update variable and function names used in 
   load.c.
 * src/load.c: renamed extern variables and functions to match definitions in 
   Sdf2-Load.c.
 * src/main.c: reformatted.

Sun Dec  2 16:08:25 EST 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Bumped version to 2.6

Sun Dec  2 15:52:41 EST 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * src/sdf2table.src,src/parse-sdf2.src: removed scripts
 * src/parsetablegen: renamed to sdf2table
 * src/main.c,Load-Sdf2.c: added functionality of sdf2table script and
   some more to the main parse table generator program. It can find and
   parse SDF modules on a search path now. It can parse full SDF definitions
   if given as input. See sdf2table -h for an explanation. 
 * ChangeLog: The reason for these changes is to get rid of the shell 
   script dependency, to increase the usability of SDF on Windows. 
   Also, there was never a good commandline for collecting SDF modules 
   offered by SDF. Both Meta-Environment and StrategoXT provided their 
   own stuff. SDF should be fully functional independent of these two products.

Thu Sep 13 11:40:34 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * test/regressionTests.sh.src: removed the redundant -a option from
   comparePT and added ordering of ambiguities, using orderPT, for when 
   comparePT fails.

Thu Aug 16 16:40:06 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * test/termsCommandLines, test/errorneousCommandLines: switched on the 
   injection and preference counting filters to match the old tests. Need to 
   regenerate new tests with sglr's default behaviour.

Thu Aug 16 16:22:40 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * test/termsCommandLines: changed the cyclic regression tests so that the 
   injection and preference counting filters are switched off. These filters
   do not work correctly on cyclic trees! If an ambiguous node is encountered
   on the traversal of a 'counting' filter we assume that we have already
   counted all ambiguous branches (as filtering is done from the bottom up) 
   and therefore each branch must have an equal number of injections. As an 
   optimization we only traverse one of the branches. However, if the 
   ambiguous tree has a cyclic branch then the assumption does not hold and
   the filtering results depend on the order of the children of an ambiguous
   node. This caused the mdj.cycle regression test to fail.
 * test/terms/{bi,mdj}.asfix2.org: regenerated with the injection and 
   preference counting filters switched off.

Wed Jul 11 13:27:33 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * sdf-checker/src/sdfchecker.isrc: reverted changes. 
 * sdf-checker/src/main.c: kept the -m command line option but removed the 
   ModuleID argument from the toolbus invocation. "Main" is used for the
   toolbus invocation, so that the behaviour is the same as before. The
   sdf-checker will eventually be re-implemented, but until then I'll leave it
   as is.

Thu Jun  7 17:10:49 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * sdf-checker/src/main.c: Added the module name as a command line option. 
   I'm working towards fixing bug 656, but this fix stops sdfchecker from 
   reporting when a module name is not defined. I'll fix this later...

Tue Jun  5 12:33:05 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/goto.c: fixed bug #752. We were adding reductions after each follow
   restriction was processed instead of only after all restrictions were
   processed. This led to some reductions being added for lookahead symbols
   that later became invalid. I also optimised the iteration over the lookahead 
   list.
 * test/tables/Follower.tbl: regenerated as the parse table changed.

Mon Jun  4 10:43:30 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Documentation added.

Sun May 27 12:14:01 CEST 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * test/tables/Sdf2.tbl: regenerated this regression table. The bugfix in
   goto.c filters more reductions in Sdf2.tbl. The regression parse forest
   does not change with this different table. The speed of the parser does
   improve slightly. My analysis is that the follow restrictions on LAYOUT?
   in Sdf2.sdf are meant for speed; they filter conflicts and not actual
   ambiguity.

Sat May 26 10:05:26 CEST 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * src/goto.c: fixed bug #752. The filterReductions function applies follow
   restrictions by removing and splitting reductions on certain lookaheads.
   It was rewritten from a recursive function to an iterative loop earlier.
   The error occurred in situations where there were more multiple character
   lookahead restrictions for the same symbol, and also reductions possible 
   for a different symbol with the same lookahead (i.e. a reduce/reduce 
   conflict). In the old recursive code each restriction would limit the
   possible reductions for certain lookaheads more, while in the new code
   each restriction was applied to the original set of lookahead characters.
   Note: I'm having trouble producing a small regression test for this
   bug.

Mon Apr 16 16:50:33 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Added forgotten files.

Mon Apr 16 15:06:26 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Tidied up the regression tests:
   - there were redundant terms in the test directory that the script wasn't 
     testing. I removed them. 
   - test/regressionTest: Created one script that performs the parse table 
     generation tests and the parsing of terms and erroneous input.
   - test/termsCommandLines, test/erroneousCommandLines: added. These files 
     allow us to set the options for sdf2table and sglr.
   - test/lang-types: removed.
   - test/tables/Sdf2.tbl: copied the parse table from the sglr test directory.
   - test/grammars/Sdf2.sdf: copied the grammar from the sglr test directory.
   - test/terms/mdj.{asfix2.org,cycle2}: added.
   - test/true.asfix2.org: copied from sglr as old copy wasn't a summary.

Mon Mar 19 16:38:07 CET 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Manually applied Martin's second 64-bit fix from bug 720.

Mon Mar 19 13:48:06 CET 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Manually applied Martin's 64-bit fix from bug 607. 

Fri Mar 16 10:37:56 CET 2007 <{jurgenv,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * src/parseTable-data.c: protect to static variable

Wed Mar 14 15:25:02 CET 2007 <{economop,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * Merged apified-pgen branch into trunk.

Mon Mar 12 18:41:20 CET 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Merged revisions 21145-21795 via svnmerge from
   svn+ssh://svn.cwi.nl/pgen/trunk

Mon Mar 12 18:35:55 CET 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Merged revisions 21094-21098 via svnmerge from 
   svn+ssh://svn.cwi.nl/pgen/trunk
   Resolved some conflicts with the new interface of toasfix function.

Mon Mar 12 17:27:08 CET 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Merged revisions 21013-21089 via svnmerge from 
   svn+ssh://svn.cwi.nl/pgen/trunk
   Regenerated the Backquote test to use the apified tables. The Backquote.sdf 
   grammar had some undefined sorts that I added, but it appears that 
   the sdfchecker still doesn't deal with some of the sorts correctly -- it
   still thinks they are undefined.

Mon Mar 12 17:12:26 CET 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Merged revisions 20955 via svnmerge from 
   svn+ssh://svn.cwi.nl/pgen/trunk
   Needed to regenerate Sdf2.baf and the regression test parse tables as the
   Sdf2.def had changed in the merge.

Mon Mar 12 16:52:15 CET 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Merged revisions 20936-20938 via svnmerge from 
   svn+ssh://svn.cwi.nl/pgen/trunk
   I had already incorporated the void pointer casts to avoid the type punned
   pointer warning with gcc 4, but still needed to resolve some conflicts.

Mon Mar 12 15:56:43 CET 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Merged revisions 20918 via svnmerge from svn+ssh://svn.cwi.nl/pgen/trunk
   These are the changes that Jurgen made to deal with transitive and 
   non-transitive priorities. The Sdf2 definition changed so Sdf2.baf 
   and the regression test parse tables were regenerated.

Mon Mar 12 09:39:59 CET 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/processGrammar.{c,h}: renamed to ksdf2table.{c,h} to make merge with
   trunk easier.

Mon Mar 12 09:32:15 CET 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/ksdf2table.{c,h}: renamed files to processGrammar.{c,h}.

Mon Mar 12 09:27:18 CET 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/ksdf2table.{c,h}: copied from revision 18253 and replaced contents with 
   src/processGrammar.{c,h}. I should have renamed the files and not removed 
   them. This will make merging with trunk easier, I think.
 * src/processGrammar.{c,h}: removed.

Wed Mar  7 16:38:19 CET 2007 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * sdf-checker/src/*: regenerated after fixing warnings and errors

Fri Mar  2 10:32:52 CET 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/pgenOptions.c: using the new config-support API.

Wed Feb 14 08:50:33 CET 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * sdf-checker/src/Sdf-Checker.c: regenerated after fixing a weird bug (import
   relation was inverted by an equation at post-check time). Also, I improved
   a number of error messages, by explaining in the error message why an attribute is 'illegal'.


Tue Jan 30 07:52:14 CET 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * src/Sdf2-Normalization.c: forgot to implement renaming for non-transitive
   priorities.

Fri Jan 26 09:28:10 CET 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * src/parsetablegen.c: adapted to new interface of toasfix function.
 * removevarsyntax/src/removevarssyntax.c: adapted to new interface of toasfix function.
 * sdf-checker/src/sdfchecker.c: adapted to new interface of toasfix function.

Thu Jan 25 19:07:17 CET 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * approximately around this time: added semantics of non-transitive
   priorities. Associativity is translated to non-transitieve priorities
   in specific arguments. The priority closure computation is only done
   using transitive priorities after that.

Thu Jan 25 19:07:17 CET 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * tests/grammars: added Backquote test grammar

Tue 2007-01-23    <storm@cwi.nl>
  * src/Sdf2-Normalization.c: incorporated fixes wrt lifting of 
    sorts (only completely uppercase sorts with no dashes were 
    correctly lifted to syntax). (closes #694)

Mon Jan 22 13:55:16 CET 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/goto.c: added (void *) casts in ATprotectArray to avoid
   'dereferencing type punned pointers' warnings.
   
Thu Jan 18 18:12:59 CET 2007 <martin.bravenboer@gmail.com>

  Fixes for Bug 685: Associatvity no longer applied to parse table

  * src/ksdf2table.c: the elements of 'nonTransitivePrioEntries'
    should be added to the priority_table, which should happen after
    determining the transitive closure.
  * grammar/Sdf2.baf: regenerated for the bug fixed by this commit.
  * test/tables/*.tbl: regenerated the parse tables use for
    regression testing.
  * pgen desperately needs a better testsuite. In particular, the
    various filters should be tested at a more fined-grained level. In
    this case, the bug did not popup earlier because of the post-parse
    priority filter that still resolved the ambiguities. For this
    particular issue that is now a test in Stratego/XT, but pgen
    itself should really check this.

Fri Jan 12 15:35:46 CET 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * grammars/Sdf2.baf: introduced a new operator for priorities. The "."
   can stop (full stop) the transitive closure of priorities. Example:
   A "+" A -> A > A "*" A -> A . > A "/" A -> A
                              ^^^
			      This dot makes that + is not bigger than /.
 * src/Sdf2-Normalization.c,src/ksdf2table.c: implemented the semantics
   of the . operator. 
 * src/Sdf2-Normalization.c: the normalizer translates associativities
   to non-transitive priorities now. This solves bug #678 which was
   introduced by the mapping of associativity to priority in specific
   arguments.
 * tests/tables/*: tables contain much less priorities now since the
   associativities are no longer closed under transitivity. This changes
   both the action table and the list of priorities. The regression
   tests for the terms parsed with the new tables did not need any
   updating.

Mon Sep 18 10:41:40 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Merged from trunk and updated the build environment.

Wed Sep 13 15:54:37 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/Sdf2-Normalization.c: regenerated because the normalisation was
   changed.

Wed Jun 28 14:05:22 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * test/tables/Ambi.tbl: generated Ambi.tbl that was incorrectly removed in
   the previous commit.

Tue Jun 27 17:02:33 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Imported from trunk.
 * Regenerated the |lang| regression tests since both the trunk and the branch 
   generated slightly different parse tables (mostly actions in different 
   orders).
 * Regenerated the regression test for |x-rated.flow| since the old version of
   SGLR doesn't use summaries for the errors.
 * Commented out the reject production from the |Flat.sdf| grammar and 
   regenerated test. It triggered the erroneous behaviour in SGLR, and Jurgen 
   and I cannot understand why the reject was there anyway.
 * Updated the |bi.cycle| regression test to use the count of ambiguities the
   refactored filtering in SGLR produces. 
 * Removed redundant |Ambi.tbl| from test/tables.

Thu May 18 14:52:34 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Committed missed changes to comments from the migration from CVS. 
Wed May  3 14:00:05 CEST 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Bumped to 2.4

Sat Apr 22 19:12:02 CEST 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * src/Sdf2-Normalization.c: And yes indeed, see previous logmessage, there was 
   a mistake in the last bugfix and I should have seen this from the
   tables. Fixed the bug now, after regular, priorities are generated
   that need to be normalized. So in fact, priorities depend on regular.
   Added the dependency and the call from r[[.]] to p[[. ]].
 * test/grammars/List.sdf: a test designed to test the dependency between
   r[[.]] and p[[.]]

Wed Apr 19 20:41:30 CEST 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * src/Sdf2-Normalization.c: regenerated again. There were serious
   errors in a number of locations:
     - regular expressions were not expanded from productions generated
       out of context-free priorities sections. This was because p[[.]]
       was applied after r[[.]].
     - the Character table was not complete enough, it still depended on 
       the old type-less implementations of characters to work correctly.
     - literal expansion was not syntax-safe, error were generated by the
       asf-checker.
 * src/Sdf2-Normalization.c: regenerated after fixing a serious bug
   in the normalization of groups of productions with selection
   of a particular argument for a priority.
 * NOTE: the parse tables generated are all different now, but the
   parse trees that come out are the same. I choose to conclude that
   my changes must be correct, but I'm not completely sure. There
   are many factors involved here: bugfixes in the ASF compiler,
   the new structured lexicals features, bugfixes in the SDF Normalizer,
   and so forth.

Wed Apr 19 20:37:59 CEST 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * test/**: added regress-terms.sh.src and all regression tests from
   the sglr package. Regenerated the .org files, since they may be
   different. Here will we test the parse trees with new parse tables
   every time. This is practical for one thing only: if the parse tables
   are not the same anymore, but the parse trees are still the same
   this is a good hint that the change in the parse table was not wrong.
 
Tue Apr 18 16:28:24 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Changed |conflicts| to |PGEN_isPriorityConflict|.
 * Instead of manually reversing the symbols on the lhs of a production in 
   |init_dependency| use |PT_reverseSymbols|.
 * Removed a premature optimisation from the |union_follow_sets|. The
   optimisation terminated the search for dependencies if there were no 
   dependencies in the set, instead of iterating over the production numbers. 
					  
Mon Apr 10 14:55:30 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Moved priority_table into |parseTable-data.c|.

Mon Apr  3 10:33:54 CEST 2006 <ecconomop@cwi.nl>
 * Changes pgen to use |processGrammar.{c,h}| instead of |ksdf2table.{c,h}|.

Mon Apr  3 10:15:41 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Renamed |ksdf2table.{c,h}| to |processGrammar.{c,h}|.

Wed Mar 29 15:33:55 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Removed the Win32 macro checks for the toolbus.

Tue Mar 28 16:25:52 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Imported changes from trunk using cvsmerge.

Mon Mar 27 16:24:05 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Continued refactoring...
 * Renamed |SDFflattenLookAhead| to |implodeLookahead| and split up recursion.
 * Apified the implosion of the follow restrictions.
 * Renamed |restrict| to |filterReductions| in goto.c and changed the
   recursion to iteration. As a result the order that the reduce with
   lookahead reductions are printed in the parse tables has reversed.
 * Regenerated the regression test for Follower as the parse table
   representation has changed.
 * Created |parseTable-data.{c,h}| which encapsulates the data structures used
   during parse table generation. Most, if not all, global variables and
   macros have disappeared. 
 * Created |parseTable-stats.{c,h}| which encapsulates the statistics logging
   and printing during parse table generation.
 * Added some comments ;-)

Fri Mar 17 13:45:49 CET 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Using the new statistics logging in |c-library| package and removed
   statistics.{c,h}.
 * Created |pgenOptions.{c,h}| to handle the command line options.

Wed Mar  8 17:35:24 CET 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Completed apification and removed most macros.


Fri Mar 10 11:36:53 CET 2006 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * **/Makefile.am:
   - Maintainers use ATerm-dbg library

Tue Feb 28 11:13:30 CET 2006 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * {removevarsyntax/src/removevarsyntax, sdf-checker/src/sdfchecker}.c:
   - printing default usage exits with exit value 1

Mon Feb 27 17:31:54 CET 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Continuing apification...
 * Removed |parse-table.c|.

Thu Feb 23 17:29:42 CET 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Apifying parse table creation...
 * Completed apification of |characters.c|.
 * Moved the parse tables generated by the regression tests to /var/tmp.

Tue Feb 21 15:07:51 CET 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * pgen/Sdf2-Normalization.c: reactivated promoting productions
   that are part of priority grammars to syntax grammars. This to
   prevent the code duplication that occurs in the C and Java Expression
   grammars. The original reason to turn this off were the fact that
   productions attributes are merged by the normalizer, such that
   sometimes productions that look the same, are not the same. This lead
   to matching failures. Another solution (static checking) needs to be
   introduced to fix that problem.

Tue Feb 21 13:29:51 CET 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * sdfchecker/src/*: closed bug 464, added full support for
   renamings.

Tue Feb 14 15:05:30 CET 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Not using new parse table format yet. Will apify according to the old format
   first.
 * Merged from trunk.

Thu Feb  9 15:28:59 CET 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * In process of using new parsetable format
 * This branch uses a new parse table defined in |ptable-support|.
 * Removed the vi folding tags from all c files.

Tue Jan 31 17:55:26 CET 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * removevarssyntax: This tool removes the variable definitions
   from an SDF module or definition. It used to be located in the
   package for ASF, but since it is ASF independent I've put it here.

Wed Jan 18 16:29:16 CET 2006 <{jurgenv,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * src/Makefile.am,package,configure.in: got rid of transitive
   dependencies of asc-support by using asc-support-config script
   at configure time.

Wed Jan  4 17:42:45 CET 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * normalizer: Implemented case-insensitive literals.
 * tests: added test for ci literals.

Fri Dec 23 10:32:37 CET 2005 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * grammar/Sdf2.baf: added syntax for case-insensitive literals.
   A literal spelled with single quoted, like 'true', generates
   [Tt][Rr][Uu][Ee] -> 'true', such that true can be spelled with
   any combination of lowercase and uppercase characters.
   TODO: regenerate normalizer

Fri Nov 18 16:17:12 CET 2005 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * src/sdf2table.src:
   - Output filename does not contain .def. anymore when using definition as 
     input

Thu Aug 18 14:24:25 CEST 2005 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * grammar/Sdf2.baf: regenerated the parse table with a different
   basic/Comments module such that comments and todo's are put in
   their categories (for syntax highlighting)

Tue Aug 16 16:43:30 CEST 2005 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 *  sdf-checker/spec/*.{asf,sdf}   The checker accumulates the
    errors and warnings now PER MODULE, such that only the errors for
    a specific module may be extracted, although the entire specification
    had to be analyzed to come up with these errors.


Mon Aug 15 16:37:59 CEST 2005 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * sdf-checker/spec/*.{asf,sdf}: 
   - used utilities/Parsing to map subjects of errors to string. This 
     replaces the manual "to-str" functions.
   - Renamed some error messages, removing "in module" postfixes,
     and adding descriptions of subjects.
   - For all 'double declaration'-like errors and warnings, added
     location for both instances such that the user can click on them.
   - The right-hand side of renamings are now interpreted as 
     definitions of symbols, such that you do not need to give a 
     dummy production to suppress a warning message.

Mon Aug 15 15:08:29 CEST 2005 <jong@cwi.nl>

     where appropriate (such as in labels, prefix functions).
   - Unquoted literal symbols are syntactically disallowed from now on!
   - Introduced new non-terminal: ATermAttribute, such that associativity
     and other attributes (avoid, reject, bracket, prefer)
     can be rejected from it. Nested occurrences (inside an ATerm attribute)
     are now possible.
