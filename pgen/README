SDF2 parser generator


Installation Instructions
=========================

1) Required packages.

   The parser generator requires the following packages:

   -GNU make, available from:
       www.gnu.org

   -The ASF+SDF compiler runtime library, available from:
       www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/

   -The ATerm library, available from:
       www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/

   -The pt-support library, available from:
       www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/

   -The sdf-support library, available from:
       www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/

   -The asf-support library, available from:
       www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/

   -The Scannerless Generalized LR Parser (sglr), available from:
       www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/

   Before building the parser generator, you should first install these
   packages.

2) Configuring the parser generator.

   Assuming that the aterm library, the support libraries, the 
   runtime library, and sglr are installed in <aterm>, <pt-support>, 
   <sdf-support>, <asf-support>, <asc-support>, and <sglr> respectively 
   and that the parser generator should be installed in <pgen> then the 
   following command will configure pgen accordingly:

   ./configure --prefix=<pgen> --with-aterm=<aterm> \
               --with-pt-support=<pt-support> \
               --with-sdf-support=<sdf-support> \
               --with-asf-support=<asf-support> \
               --with-asc-support=<asc-support> \
               --with-sglr=<sglr>

   Note. Default behaviour of configure is that it will look for libraries
         in <prefix>/lib and for executables in your search paths. So,
         you do not need to specify the locations of all these packages
         explicitly (as we did in the example above).

   If you use gcc, pgen is built with "gcc -Wall -g -O2". If you prefer
   different options use --with-cflags="<options>" when you run configure.

   ./configure --help gives a detailed list of configuration options.       

3) Building the parser generator.

   Assuming that GNU make is called "gmake" on your system then the
   following commands will build and install the parser generator:

   gmake
   gmake install

4) Checking the parser generator.

   The parser generator can be tested via:

   gmake check

5) Bug reporting and support.

   Please report bugs via:

   http://www.cwi.nl/htbin/MetaEnv/meta-bugs

   This is the general bug reporting page of the ASF+SDF Meta-Environment.

   Support can be obtained via:

6) Known bugs.

   None.
