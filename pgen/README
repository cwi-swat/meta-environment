SDF2 parser generator


Installation Instructions
=========================

1) Required packages.

  The parser generator requires the following packages:

  -GNU make, available from:
      www.gnu.org

  -The ASF+SDF compiler runtime library, available from:
      www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/progsoft

  -The ATerm library, available from:
      www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/progsoft

  -The Scannerless Generalized LR Parser (sglr), available from:
      www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/progsoft

  -The ToolBus, available from:
      www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/progsoft

  Before building the parser generator, you should first install these
  packages.

2) Configuring the parser generator.

  Assuming that the aterm library, sglr, and the toolbus are installed in
  <aterm>, <sglr>, and <toolbus> respectively and that the parser generator
  should be installed in <pgen> then the following command will configure
  pgen accordingly:

  ./configre --with-aterm=<aterm> --with-sglr=<sglr> --with-toolbus=<toolbus>

  Note. The location of sglr needs only to be specified when sglr is not
  included in your path during the compilation of the parser generator. 
  After installation the parse generator uses your PATH variable to locate
  sglr.

3) Building the parser generator

   Assuming that GNU make is called "gmake" on your system then the
   following commands will build and install the parser generator:

   > gmake
   > gmake install
