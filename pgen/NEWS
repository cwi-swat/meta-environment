Version 0.8:
  * Added -m to normalizer.
  * Context-free functions defined in priority section are no
    longer promoted to ordinary syntax section. Thus it is no
    longer possible to define a (context-free) function by giving
    only the priority declaration.
  * Small bug removed in normalizer which causes r[[LAYOUT]] to occur
    as a non normalized term.
