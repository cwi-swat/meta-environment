Offside -- filter parse forests with the offside rule

This package provides one tools that interprets the 'offside' production
attribute to implement an offside filter.

The tool filters all parse trees that have a production labeled with 'offside' 
with horizontal position h that has at least one (recursive) child labeled with offside that has a horizontal position strictly less than h.
