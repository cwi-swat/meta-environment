/** \defgroup parseForest parseForest
 *
 * This is the module containing the parse forest construction and filtering 
 * functions.
 *
 * Most applications that use a parser require the syntactic representation of 
 * the parse to be output. Whilst deterministic parsers can only derive 
 * strings in one way, non-deterministic, or more specifically ambiguous, 
 * parsers can have multiple derivations for the same string.
 * 
 * Deterministic parsers usually build a parse tree representation of a 
 * derivation. Parse trees are straightforward to counstruct during a parse 
 * and are reletively space efficient. However, if multiple derivations of a 
 * single string are possible, as is the case with non-deterministic parsers, 
 * then a more efficient structure is required. There are three different 
 * approaches that have been suggested in the literature: 
 * \li construct a grammar whose language is the derivation(s) of the 
 * sentence~\cite{Lang}, 
 * \li build a graph representation of the derivation(s)~\cite{Earley,Tomita}, 
 * \li produce the well-formed substring table used during recognition of the 
 * string~\cite{Cocke,Younger,Kasami}. 
 *
 * The best representation is one that can be constructed efficiently in 
 * time and space, and from which a single derivation can be easily extracted.
 * -- How can we justify the selection of a parse forest representation based 
 * on the above criteria? (Paul has suggested using relations to represent 
 * the links between nodes in the forest. Can this be discussed here?)
 * 
 * An important goal of a generalised parser, such as SGLR, is the efficient 
 * construction of a parse's parse forests; the size of the structure, and the 
 * time taken to build it, should be minimal. Unfortunately, these two 
 * properties are in tension with each other. The sharing of nodes should be 
 * optimal to reduce the size of the forest, but this requires extra searching 
 * during a parse, which inadvertently makes the algorithm slower. (Clearly,
 * choosing the right data structure to represent the parse forests is critical 
 * to the performance of a generalised parser.) Parse forests in SGLR are 
 * represented by the ATerm data-type and are constructed using the ATerm 
 * Library.
 * 
 * Two of the features that the ATerm Library provides simplify the 
 * construction of parse forests: all nodes (ATerms) are maximally shared, which
 * ensures that the size of the forest is minimal, and garbage 
 * collection is automatic. The maximal sharing of nodes is achieved by 
 * checking to see if a node already exists before it is created. However, for 
 * this to be possible nodes cannot be modified after creation, or in other 
 * words, only non-destructive updates of nodes is allowed. Unfortunatelly 
 * this complicates the construction of a forest during parsing (elaborate).
 *
 * The size of the parse forest can be controlled by implementing sub-tree 
 * sharing and local ambiguity packing.
 *
 * \section parseForests Parse forest representation in SGLR
 *
 * What SGLR calls ambiguity nodes are actually packing nodes. Their children 
 * are sub-trees that derive the same portion of the input string in different 
 * ways. These ambiguity nodes are introduced to pack the different derivations
 * into one tree, effectively sharing the tree above.
 *
 * 
 * Think about implementing temporary parse tree nodes that allow destructive 
 * updates while new ambiguous sub-trees can be created and then convert them 
 * to ATerms as soon as possible. This would make filtering faster as better 
 * memoization could be done and new nodes would only need to be created when a 
 * tree is filtered. Can this node creation for filtering be improved upon? 
 * What would happen if we used a specific data structure.
 *
 * \subsection AmbiTables
 * An entry in the ambiTable contains all parse trees of an ambiguous node and 
 * is indexed on a single parse tree and the start position of the string it 
 * derives. 
 *
 * \todo publish an algorithm that filters parse forests based on our
 * disambiguation filters with complexity and actual performance analysis.
