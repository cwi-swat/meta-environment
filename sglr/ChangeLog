   * Bug fix in libsglr/sglr-interface.c. SGparseStringAsAsFix2 used ATBpack
     to pack the complete parse term which caused pattern matching in
     sglr/sglr.idef to fail.

2000/7/11 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
   * Bug fixed in regress-test/grammars/Makefile.am which caused make dist
     to fail

2000/6/28 (js@cwi.nl)
   * Cycles are reported with expanded productions rather than production
     numbers

2000/6/28 (js@cwi.nl)
   * Bumped version to 2.36
   * Refactored forest yielding/ambiguity tracking code: ambiguity
     tracking is now cleanly separated
   * Added `ambtrakker', a command-line tool that conveniently lists
     ambiguities found in AsFix2; by adding a ToolBus interface to
     this tool, a modular disambiguator (sort of) could be provided
     in a Meta-Environmant that uses AsFix2 for exchange format
   * Added version reporting to tree2dot

2000/6/27 (js@cwi.nl)
   *  Bumped version to 2.35
   *  Implemented ambiguity collection code: when asked to return AsFix1,
      a parse error is now generated that includes a list of pairs
      in which for each ambiguity, its position in the input
      term as well as the relevant productions are included.  An example
      (prettyprinted for your convenience):

         module Amber
         exports
           sorts A B
           lexical syntax
            [a]+ -> A
            [a]+ -> B

      js:p5@dek[275]> print -n "a" | sglr -p Amber.tbl -t1
      parse-error([character(256),line(1),col(1),char(2)],
                  ambiguities(1,[ambiguity(position(0),
                                 productions(prod([cf(opt(layout)),
                                                   cf(sort("A")),
                                                   cf(opt(layout))],
                                                  sort("<START>"),no-attrs),
                                             prod([cf(opt(layout)),
                                                   cf(sort("B")),
                                                   cf(opt(layout))],
                                                  sort("<START>"),no-attrs)))]))
      sglr: error in -, line 1, col 1: cannot represent 1 ambiguity

2000/6/23 (js@cwi.nl)
   *  Fixed a tiny bug in sglr's handling of follow restrictions
      of levels deeper than 1
   *  Added the Follower language, and both an offending and a
      non-offending input term w.r.t. the follow-restrictions
   *  Bumped version to 2.34

2000/5/15 (js@cwi.nl)
   * Extended the SGLR API documentation to cover greater detail
   * Fixed a case of usage of uninitialized AFun (that broke the daily build)
   * Implemented a routine that returns the available start symbols,
     available through both ToolBus as well as the public API
   * Bumped the version number (now at 2.32)

2000/5/13 (js@cwi.nl)
   * Documented (pod) the SGLR API
   * Cleaned up function naming to strictly use thepublic vs. private
     convention; accordingly, several cleanups/reshuffles in bits
     containing public routines especially

2000/5/04 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
   * sglr -l now also displays number of reductions per token

2000/4/05 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
   * Removed doc/a2toa1.pod because it now lives in the separate asfix
     distribution
   * manual pages are no longer stored in section 7 but in section 1

2000/4/05 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
   * Version is now 2.29
   * The asfix2 to asfix1 conversion stuff has been removed because it is
     now part of the asfix distribution.

2000/3/31 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
   * The toolbus is no longer required during the build process of sglr

2000/3/28 (mdejonge @cwi.nl)
   * No longer distribute DEVELOPERS-INFO

2000/3/2 (mdejong@cwi.nl)
   * sglr build/configuration now using automake

1999/8/30
   * New metric: number of rejects encountered.

1999/8/15 (EV)
   * Extra metrics: calls to SG_Amb, allocated ATerm memory, page faults,
     ambiguities, number of lines, characters per second
   * Characters per second is the main metric we want to improve
