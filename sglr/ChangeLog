2000/6/23 (js@cwi.nl)
   *  Fixed a tiny bug in sglr's handling of follow restrictions
      of levels deeper than 1
   *  Added the Follower language, and both an offending and a
      non-offending input term w.r.t. the follow-restrictions
   *  Bumped version to 2.34

2000/5/15 (js@cwi.nl)
   * Extended the SGLR API documentation to cover greater detail
   * Fixed a case of usage of uninitialized AFun (that broke the daily build)
   * Implemented a routine that returns the available start symbols,
     available through both ToolBus as well as the public API
   * Bumped the version number (now at 2.32)

2000/5/13 (js@cwi.nl)
   * Documented (pod) the SGLR API
   * Cleaned up function naming to strictly use thepublic vs. private
     convention; accordingly, several cleanups/reshuffles in bits
     containing public routines especially

2000/5/04 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
   * sglr -l now also displays number of reductions per token

2000/4/05 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
   * Removed doc/a2toa1.pod because it now lives in the separate asfix
     distribution
   * manual pages are no longer stored in section 7 but in section 1

2000/4/05 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
   * Version is now 2.29
   * The asfix2 to asfix1 conversion stuff has been removed because it is
     now part of the asfix distribution.

2000/3/31 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
   * The toolbus is no longer required during the build process of sglr

2000/3/28 (mdejonge @cwi.nl)
   * No longer distribute DEVELOPERS-INFO

2000/3/2 (mdejong@cwi.nl)
   * sglr build/configuration now using automake

1999/8/30
   * New metric: number of rejects encountered.

1999/8/15 (EV)
   * Extra metrics: calls to SG_Amb, allocated ATerm memory, page faults,
     ambiguities, number of lines, characters per second
   * Characters per second is the main metric we want to improve
