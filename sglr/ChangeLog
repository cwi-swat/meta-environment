 * ambtracker functionality and tool moved to pt-support package

2001/07/20 ({jong,markvdb,olivierp}@cwi.nl)
 * Adapted for new parsetable format (marginally more compact)
 * Regenerated parsetables accordingly
 
2001/07/17 (jong@cwi.nl)
 * version 3.3 released, bumped to 3.3.1

2001/07/13 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Bug fix: if all ambiguous nodes disappear, then return
    NULL.

2001/07/12 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Bug fix: a single node is never ambiguous, so "amb" removed!

2001/07/11 (jong@cwi.nl)
 * patched Makefile.am's to comply with new location of -lATB.

2001/07/11 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Bug fix in dealing with filtering over injections. Sometimes it
    stopped in a non-application node.

2001/07/09 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Fixed a bug in yielding the parse tree, it is possible, that
    due to filtering the parse tree becomes empty and thus a
    parse bug is discovered.

2001/07/06 (jurgenv@cwi.nl, markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Removed AsFix1 stuff and AsFix2ME is now the default output
    of SGLR.

2001/07/04 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Propagation of NULL trees was not correctly handled.

2001/06/27 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Repaired a bug detected by Peter Mosses with respect to priorities,
    implemented what is described in Section 4.5.1 (Priority Conflicts) in
    Eelco's PhD thesis.

2001/06/13 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Removed PosInfo related code.
  * Removed BOEHM related "if-def"s.

  * Changed size of state and label into int (was short).

2001/05/23 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Released version 3.2.2, and bumped into 3.2.3.

2001/05/21 ({jurgenv,markvdb,jong}@cwi.nl)
  * Fixed bug in prefer/avoid filtering. Trees with equal avoids and prefers
    can not be disambiguated.
 
2001/05/11 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Added Set, Perm, Numbered iterator, and Function.

2001/05/04 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Added pair symbol.

2001/05/03 (jong@cwi.nl)
 * version 3.2.2
 * cleaned up all Makefile.ams that caused "make install" to rebuild
   (=recompile) due to wrong -I include paths.
 * removed JS legacy ("crippled platform" remark erased)

2001/04/23 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
  * Increased version number to 3.2.1

2001/04/23 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
  * Fixed library search-paths in ./dump, ./client, and ./ambtracker

2001/03/27 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * added six options to libsglr. Each option toggles the use of
    a specific disambigation filter.

2001/03/22 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Fixed a serious bug in filtering of assocativity. 
    Revealed by the following grammar (by Peter D. Mosses):

    module AN-Full

    imports Layout

    exports
      sorts Action Yielder DataOp

    context-free syntax
      Action Yielder          -> Action

      "give" Yielder          -> Action
      "give" DataOp           -> Action
      "skip"                 -> Action
      Action "then" Action    -> Action {left}

      "it"                    -> DataOp

      Action                  -> Yielder
      DataOp                  -> Yielder
      Yielder "then" Yielder  -> Yielder {left}       

2001/03/15 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Fixed a bug concerning the filtering of trees containing "rejects"
    - New filter introduced which compares two trees and selects
      the one without any rejects (if any).
  
2001/02/27 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Fixed location of parsetree libraries 

2001/02/22 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Introduced the "-m" option to generate AsFix2ME.
  * SGLR is no longer dependent on the "old" asfix library.
  * New version (3.20 of SGLR.

2000/12/14 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Re-implemented the "no parse tree contruction" option, however
    in a slightly different way. No nodes are constructed, and in
    FindPaths the list of sons is neither constructed.

2000/12/14 (markvdb@cwi.nl, olivierp@cwi.nl, jong@cwi.nl)
  * Simplified actiontable implementation
  * Counting avoids and prefers filter improved.
  * New version (3.1) of SGLR.

2000/11/17 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Several (serious) memory leaks fixed.

2000/11/08 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
    * ambtrakker renamed to ambtracker

2000/11/04 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
    * Bug fix: of by one error in SG_ReadFile (sglr-interface,c)
      which caused sglr to dump core when reading from standard input  is
      fixed.

2000/10/18 (jurgenv@cwi.nl, markvdb@cwi.nl)
  - Major revision of SGLR!
    * Filtering is moved from shifting/reducing phase to a postprocessing
      phase.
    * All filtering code completely refactored.
    * Efficiency of cycle detection is improved.
    * Efficiency of filtering improved.
    * Position information yielded by AmbTracker has been corrected.
    * Remove a lot of dead and obscure code.
    * New filter added: associativity filter.
  - Bumped into version 3.0!       

2000/10/02 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * A major oversight in filtering fixed:
    - Nested ambiguity clusters were ignored during filtering.
      This caused the "eager" list behaviour of Ernst-Jan Verhoeven!
    - The fix involved also an runtime check on cycles.
      Perfomance penalty has still to be figured out.
  * Bumped version to 2.40

2000/9/27 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Fixed a bug in the lookahead when operating in ToolBus mode.
  * In case of ToolBus mode or stand-alone mode the same buffer
    is being used. Some code has become obsolete and is removed.

2000/9/18 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
  * All file references in sglr-stats.txt are now quoted

2000/8/25 (jong@cwi.nl)
  * In verbose mode, animated counter is only displayed if stderr is a tty.

2000/8/09 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Fixed a major bug that caused sglr to dump core while reading parsetables
    in some infrequently occurring cases.
  * Added prettyprinting of ambiguous productions
  * Bumped version to 2.39
  
2000/8/01 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Fixed a major bug that caused sglr to throw away ambiguities
  * Bumped version to 2.38

2000/7/28 (jong@cwi.nl)
  * In verbose mode, sglr prints which token-# it is parsing/shifting.

2000/7/12 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
   * "char *L" replaced by "language L" where "language" is a typedef ATerm.
     L is used as key in the parsetable database.

2000/7/12 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
   * Bug fix in libsglr/sglr-interface.c. SGparseStringAsAsFix2 used ATBpack
     to pack the complete parse term which caused pattern matching in
     sglr/sglr.idef to fail.

2000/7/11 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
   * Bug fixed in regress-test/grammars/Makefile.am which caused make dist
     to fail

2000/6/28 (js@cwi.nl)
   * Cycles are reported with expanded productions rather than production
     numbers

2000/6/28 (js@cwi.nl)
   * Bumped version to 2.36
   * Refactored forest yielding/ambiguity tracking code: ambiguity
     tracking is now cleanly separated
   * Added `ambtrakker', a command-line tool that conveniently lists
     ambiguities found in AsFix2; by adding a ToolBus interface to
     this tool, a modular disambiguator (sort of) could be provided
     in a Meta-Environmant that uses AsFix2 for exchange format
   * Added version reporting to tree2dot

2000/6/27 (js@cwi.nl)
   *  Bumped version to 2.35
   *  Implemented ambiguity collection code: when asked to return AsFix1,
      a parse error is now generated that includes a list of pairs
      in which for each ambiguity, its position in the input
      term as well as the relevant productions are included.  An example
      (prettyprinted for your convenience):

         module Amber
         exports
           sorts A B
           lexical syntax
            [a]+ -> A
            [a]+ -> B

      js:p5@dek[275]> print -n "a" | sglr -p Amber.tbl -t1
      parse-error([character(256),line(1),col(1),char(2)],
                  ambiguities(1,[ambiguity(position(0),
                                 productions(prod([cf(opt(layout)),
                                                   cf(sort("A")),
                                                   cf(opt(layout))],
                                                  sort("<START>"),no-attrs),
                                             prod([cf(opt(layout)),
                                                   cf(sort("B")),
                                                   cf(opt(layout))],
                                                  sort("<START>"),no-attrs)))]))
      sglr: error in -, line 1, col 1: cannot represent 1 ambiguity

2000/6/23 (js@cwi.nl)
   *  Fixed a tiny bug in sglr's handling of follow restrictions
      of levels deeper than 1
   *  Added the Follower language, and both an offending and a
      non-offending input term w.r.t. the follow-restrictions
   *  Bumped version to 2.34

2000/5/15 (js@cwi.nl)
   * Extended the SGLR API documentation to cover greater detail
   * Fixed a case of usage of uninitialized AFun (that broke the daily build)
   * Implemented a routine that returns the available start symbols,
     available through both ToolBus as well as the public API
   * Bumped the version number (now at 2.32)

2000/5/13 (js@cwi.nl)
   * Documented (pod) the SGLR API
   * Cleaned up function naming to strictly use thepublic vs. private
     convention; accordingly, several cleanups/reshuffles in bits
     containing public routines especially

2000/5/04 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
   * sglr -l now also displays number of reductions per token

2000/4/05 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
   * Removed doc/a2toa1.pod because it now lives in the separate asfix
     distribution
   * manual pages are no longer stored in section 7 but in section 1

2000/4/05 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
   * Version is now 2.29
   * The asfix2 to asfix1 conversion stuff has been removed because it is
     now part of the asfix distribution.

2000/3/31 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
   * The toolbus is no longer required during the build process of sglr

2000/3/28 (mdejonge @cwi.nl)
   * No longer distribute DEVELOPERS-INFO

2000/3/2 (mdejong@cwi.nl)
   * sglr build/configuration now using automake

1999/8/30
   * New metric: number of rejects encountered.

1999/8/15 (EV)
   * Extra metrics: calls to SG_Amb, allocated ATerm memory, page faults,
     ambiguities, number of lines, characters per second
   * Characters per second is the main metric we want to improve
