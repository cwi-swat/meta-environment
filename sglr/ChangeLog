 * Set version to 3.10.1

2003/07/30 (markvdb@cs.vu.nl)
 * Fixed the injection bug reported by Albert Hofkamp.
   Added the corresponding regression test.

2003/07/24 ({markvdb, jurgenv}@cwi.nl)
 * Improved the bug fix of 2003/07/23. Finally understood the
   problem, which is not caused by the combination of ambiguities
   and cycles, but by the fact that the optimalization introduced
   to inspect ambiguity clusters only once. This optimalization
   causes the position information to be out of sync, which eventually
   leads to not finding ambiguity clusters down the road.

2003/07/23 (markvdb@cs.vu.nl)
 * Fixed a serious bug wrt the combination of ambiguities and
   cycles.

2003/07/02 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)

 * The -c option (switch cycle detection off) does no longer imply
   switching of filtering as well.

2002/09/16 (vandenbr@loria.fr)
 * Treatment of eagerness and injections improved, jumping
   over injections stops as soon as an (un)eager node is 
   found. This bug was discovered by Robbert de Haan.

2001/11/07 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Version number introduced in the parse table format.

2001/11/01 ({jurgenv,markvdb}@cwi.nl)
2001/10/31 ({jurgenv,markvdb}@cwi.nl)
 * Fixed a bug with respect to storing filtered ambiguity clusters.
   
2001/10/30 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
 * Makefile.am: added program-check.m4 to EXTRA_DIST variable
 * Makefile.am: removed ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS

2001/10/30 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * BitMap introduced to mark that for a specific position a
   ambiguity cluster was created.
 * Performance back to normal.

2001/10/29 (jurgenv@cwi.nl, markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Replaced SG_MARK and UNMARK by an ATermIndexedSet implementation.
 * Marking only ambiguity clusters when detecting cycles.
 * Completely refactored the code for ambiguity clusters (markvdb).
 * The changes of the last days fix a major bug in sglr; sharing of ambiguity
   clusters caused ambiguities to occur in terms were there are no ambiguities
   due to lexical or context-free restrictions.
 * NOTE: SGLR is now quite a bit slower! 
         A smarter implementation of the current bugfix is needed.
 * NOTE: SGLR can yield different parse trees than previous versions 
         because there are less ambiguities. This effect can be expected
         for grammars that are highly ambiguous (e.g Casl, Island Grammars).
 * The regression tests for Casl have been updated.

2001/10/25-26 (jurgenv@cwi.nl,markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Added position information to the ambiguity cluster table in order
   to make ambiguity clusters unique.
 * Links and paths are extended with a length field.
 * During cycle detection and filtering the position information
   is updated.

2001/10/11 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
 * Changed order of EXTRA_DIST files

2001/09/27 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Due to some changes in the pt-support package, sglr now emits different
   parsetrees in both AsFix2 and AsFix2me. The changes are about the
   attributes of a production. See the ChangeLog of pt-support for details.
 * NOTE: the new parse tree format is not backward compatible.
 
2001/09/21 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added -u switch to dump-productions (unparses the productions).

2001/08/31 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Version 3.5beta.
 * Improved (I hope you are never sure in life) the prefer/avoid
   count filter. Only unique occurences are taken into account.
   This means that a subtree with a preferred/avoided production
   which occurs also in the other tree is not counted.

2001/08/28 (jong@cwi.nl)
 * unused static function outcommented to satisfy gcc-3.0.1

2001/08/20 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Added an option (-A) to treat an ambiguity as an error.
 * Removed option (-P) for adding position information.

2001/08/09 (markvdb@cwi.nl, jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * MultiSet calculation removed, replaced by a simpler
   Avoid/Prefer counting mechanism.
 * Renamed MultiSetCounting to PreferCounting.
 * Reshuffled some code.
 * Wrote alternative InjectionCounting code, not yet activated.
 * Improved the DirectEagerPrefer code (looks through injections).
 * Improved the FilterReject code, rejects are inspected before
   the actual filtering kicks in.
 * Added a new test case.
 * Adapted a number of grammars in order to be prepared for
   a new injection count strategy.
 * Fixed some bugs in the regression test grammars.
 

2001/08/01 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Bugfix; topsymbols were always reports as [undefined].

2001/07/25 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Moved all tree2dot functionality to pt-support package.
 * Removed sdf1tosdf2 tool (did almost nothing).
 * Removed unused client & server frontends for sglr

2001/07/25 ({jong,markvdb,olivierp}@cwi.nl)
 * Added Prefix term to test suite
 * Moved Sdf2.sdf to test/terms dir.

2001/07/24 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * ambtracker functionality and tool moved to pt-support package

2001/07/20 ({jong,markvdb,olivierp}@cwi.nl)
 * Adapted for new parsetable format (marginally more compact)
 * Regenerated parsetables accordingly
 
2001/07/17 (jong@cwi.nl)
 * version 3.3 released, bumped to 3.3.1

2001/07/13 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Bug fix: if all ambiguous nodes disappear, then return
    NULL.

2001/07/12 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Bug fix: a single node is never ambiguous, so "amb" removed!

2001/07/11 (jong@cwi.nl)
 * patched Makefile.am's to comply with new location of -lATB.

2001/07/11 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Bug fix in dealing with filtering over injections. Sometimes it
    stopped in a non-application node.

2001/07/09 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Fixed a bug in yielding the parse tree, it is possible, that
    due to filtering the parse tree becomes empty and thus a
    parse bug is discovered.

2001/07/06 (jurgenv@cwi.nl, markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Removed AsFix1 stuff and AsFix2ME is now the default output
    of SGLR.

2001/07/04 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Propagation of NULL trees was not correctly handled.

2001/06/27 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Repaired a bug detected by Peter Mosses with respect to priorities,
    implemented what is described in Section 4.5.1 (Priority Conflicts) in
    Eelco's PhD thesis.

2001/06/13 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Removed PosInfo related code.
  * Removed BOEHM related "if-def"s.
  * Fixed a protection bug of the reject/prefer/avoid attributes.

    can not be disambiguated.
 
2001/05/11 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Added Set, Perm, Numbered iterator, and Function.

2001/05/04 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Added pair symbol.

2001/05/03 (jong@cwi.nl)
 * version 3.2.2
 * cleaned up all Makefile.ams that caused "make install" to rebuild
   (=recompile) due to wrong -I include paths.
 * removed JS legacy ("crippled platform" remark erased)

2001/04/23 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
  * Increased version number to 3.2.1

2001/04/23 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
  * Fixed library search-paths in ./dump, ./client, and ./ambtracker

2001/03/27 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * added six options to libsglr. Each option toggles the use of
    a specific disambigation filter.

2001/03/22 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Fixed a serious bug in filtering of assocativity. 
    Revealed by the following grammar (by Peter D. Mosses):

    module AN-Full

    imports Layout

    exports
      sorts Action Yielder DataOp

    context-free syntax
      Action Yielder          -> Action

      "give" Yielder          -> Action
      "give" DataOp           -> Action
      "skip"                 -> Action
      Action "then" Action    -> Action {left}

      "it"                    -> DataOp

      Action                  -> Yielder
      DataOp                  -> Yielder
      Yielder "then" Yielder  -> Yielder {left}       

2001/03/15 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Fixed a bug concerning the filtering of trees containing "rejects"
    - New filter introduced which compares two trees and selects
      the one without any rejects (if any).
  
2001/02/27 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Fixed location of parsetree libraries 

2001/02/22 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Introduced the "-m" option to generate AsFix2ME.
  * SGLR is no longer dependent on the "old" asfix library.
  * New version (3.20 of SGLR.

2000/12/14 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Re-implemented the "no parse tree contruction" option, however
    in a slightly different way. No nodes are constructed, and in
    FindPaths the list of sons is neither constructed.

2000/12/14 (markvdb@cwi.nl, olivierp@cwi.nl, jong@cwi.nl)
  * Simplified actiontable implementation
  * Counting avoids and prefers filter improved.
  * New version (3.1) of SGLR.

2000/11/17 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Several (serious) memory leaks fixed.

2000/11/08 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
    * ambtrakker renamed to ambtracker

2000/11/04 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
    * Bug fix: of by one error in SG_ReadFile (sglr-interface,c)
      which caused sglr to dump core when reading from standard input  is
      fixed.

2000/10/18 (jurgenv@cwi.nl, markvdb@cwi.nl)
  - Major revision of SGLR!
    * Filtering is moved from shifting/reducing phase to a postprocessing
      phase.
    * All filtering code completely refactored.
    * Efficiency of cycle detection is improved.
    * Efficiency of filtering improved.
    * Position information yielded by AmbTracker has been corrected.
    * Remove a lot of dead and obscure code.
    * New filter added: associativity filter.
  - Bumped into version 3.0!       

2000/10/02 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * A major oversight in filtering fixed:
    - Nested ambiguity clusters were ignored during filtering.
      This caused the "eager" list behaviour of Ernst-Jan Verhoeven!
    - The fix involved also an runtime check on cycles.
      Perfomance penalty has still to be figured out.
  * Bumped version to 2.40

2000/9/27 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Fixed a bug in the lookahead when operating in ToolBus mode.
  * In case of ToolBus mode or stand-alone mode the same buffer
    is being used. Some code has become obsolete and is removed.

2000/9/18 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
  * All file references in sglr-stats.txt are now quoted

2000/8/25 (jong@cwi.nl)
  * In verbose mode, animated counter is only displayed if stderr is a tty.

2000/8/09 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Fixed a major bug that caused sglr to dump core while reading parsetables
    in some infrequently occurring cases.
  * Added prettyprinting of ambiguous productions
  * Bumped version to 2.39
  
2000/8/01 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Fixed a major bug that caused sglr to throw away ambiguities
  * Bumped version to 2.38

2000/7/28 (jong@cwi.nl)
  * In verbose mode, sglr prints which token-# it is parsing/shifting.

2000/7/12 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
   * "char *L" replaced by "language L" where "language" is a typedef ATerm.
     L is used as key in the parsetable database.

2000/7/12 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
   * Bug fix in libsglr/sglr-interface.c. SGparseStringAsAsFix2 used ATBpack
     to pack the complete parse term which caused pattern matching in
     sglr/sglr.idef to fail.

2000/7/11 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
   * Bug fixed in regress-test/grammars/Makefile.am which caused make dist
     to fail

2000/6/28 (js@cwi.nl)
   * Cycles are reported with expanded productions rather than production
     numbers

2000/6/28 (js@cwi.nl)
   * Bumped version to 2.36
   * Refactored forest yielding/ambiguity tracking code: ambiguity
     tracking is now cleanly separated
   * Added `ambtrakker', a command-line tool that conveniently lists
     ambiguities found in AsFix2; by adding a ToolBus interface to
     this tool, a modular disambiguator (sort of) could be provided
     in a Meta-Environmant that uses AsFix2 for exchange format
   * Added version reporting to tree2dot

2000/6/27 (js@cwi.nl)
   *  Bumped version to 2.35
   *  Implemented ambiguity collection code: when asked to return AsFix1,
      a parse error is now generated that includes a list of pairs
      in which for each ambiguity, its position in the input
      term as well as the relevant productions are included.  An example
      (prettyprinted for your convenience):

         module Amber
         exports
           sorts A B
           lexical syntax
            [a]+ -> A
            [a]+ -> B

      js:p5@dek[275]> print -n "a" | sglr -p Amber.tbl -t1
      parse-error([character(256),line(1),col(1),char(2)],
                  ambiguities(1,[ambiguity(position(0),
                                 productions(prod([cf(opt(layout)),
                                                   cf(sort("A")),
                                                   cf(opt(layout))],
                                                  sort("<START>"),no-attrs),
                                             prod([cf(opt(layout)),
                                                   cf(sort("B")),
                                                   cf(opt(layout))],
                                                  sort("<START>"),no-attrs)))]))
      sglr: error in -, line 1, col 1: cannot represent 1 ambiguity

2000/6/23 (js@cwi.nl)
   *  Fixed a tiny bug in sglr's handling of follow restrictions
      of levels deeper than 1
   *  Added the Follower language, and both an offending and a
      non-offending input term w.r.t. the follow-restrictions
   *  Bumped version to 2.34

2000/5/15 (js@cwi.nl)
   * Extended the SGLR API documentation to cover greater detail
   * Fixed a case of usage of uninitialized AFun (that broke the daily build)
   * Implemented a routine that returns the available start symbols,
     available through both ToolBus as well as the public API
   * Bumped the version number (now at 2.32)

2000/5/13 (js@cwi.nl)
   * Documented (pod) the SGLR API
   * Cleaned up function naming to strictly use thepublic vs. private
     convention; accordingly, several cleanups/reshuffles in bits
     containing public routines especially

2000/5/04 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
   * sglr -l now also displays number of reductions per token

2000/4/05 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
   * Removed doc/a2toa1.pod because it now lives in the separate asfix
     distribution
   * manual pages are no longer stored in section 7 but in section 1

2000/4/05 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
   * Version is now 2.29
   * The asfix2 to asfix1 conversion stuff has been removed because it is
     now part of the asfix distribution.

2000/3/31 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
   * The toolbus is no longer required during the build process of sglr

2000/3/28 (mdejonge @cwi.nl)
   * No longer distribute DEVELOPERS-INFO

2000/3/2 (mdejong@cwi.nl)
   * sglr build/configuration now using automake

1999/8/30
   * New metric: number of rejects encountered.

1999/8/15 (EV)
   * Extra metrics: calls to SG_Amb, allocated ATerm memory, page faults,
     ambiguities, number of lines, characters per second
   * Characters per second is the main metric we want to improve
