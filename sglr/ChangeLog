 * sglr.pc.in: bumped version number.

Mon Sep 15 16:50:44 CEST 2008 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * src/sglrInterface.[ch]: added function to reset parse error
   summary (for API).

Mon Jun  9 13:23:37 CEST 2008 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * sglr.pc.in: Bumped version to 4.5.2 since SDF needs to be released.

Thu May 29 08:41:58 CEST 2008 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * doc/Mainpage.dox: removed superfluous comments.

Thu May 29 08:26:34 CEST 2008 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * src/gss/gssGarbageCollector.c: removed references to papers that
   are not used.

Fri Feb 22 10:26:35 EST 2008 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * src/inputStringBuilder,src/commandlineInterface.c: added creation
   of proper errors when input files could not be found.

Wed Jan 16 17:20:24 CET 2008 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/inputStringBuilder.c: fixed bug 822 again and hopefully didn't
   introduce any new bugs this time ;-) 

Tue Jan 15 14:25:39 CET 2008 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/sglrInterface.c, src/inputString.c: applied patch in bug 823.

Tue Jan 15 14:17:37 CET 2008 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/InputStringBuilder.c: fixed bug 822.

Thu Jan 10 11:18:01 CET 2008 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/sglrInterface.c: corrected function call of options initialization.

Wed Jan  9 18:56:20 CET 2008 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/mainOptions.{c,h}: added SGLR prefix to global variables to avoid 
   conflict with PGEN.

Thu Dec 20 03:29:18 CET 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/gss/gssNode.c: corrected counting of rejected nodes.
 * src/parseForest/filterOptions.c: corrected the printing of filtering options.

Thu Dec 13 15:10:34 CET 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/gss/gss.c: corrected an off-by-one error. It was causing a segmentation 
   fault in some experiments.

Wed Dec 12 17:13:04 CET 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/*: added some more stat counting (rejected GSS nodes) and removed some 
   redundant counting.

Tue Dec  4 11:45:13 CET 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/commandLineInterface.c: added the -m flag to stop the parse tree from
   being output. Useful for performace comparisons with other tools.
 * src/parserOptions.{c,h}: added code to handle new flag.

Tue Dec  4 11:17:02 CET 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/parser/parserStatistics.{c,h}: commented out the code that collects and
   prints the stats on the number of edge visits done for each level. I don't
   think they are useful and should probably be completely removed.

Fri Nov 30 13:58:27 CET 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/gss/gss.c: fixed bug 800. The currentLevel was being cleared after
   garbage collection was performed on the GSS. I think this is what caused sglr   to fail to terminate after the second parse was completed.

Mon Nov 26 18:06:32 EST 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * src/commandlineInterface.c: fixed one todo: a proper error message
   when the parse table file is not found.

 * src/inputStringBuilder.c: set the buffer size to 10KB.
 * src/Makefile.am: added comments.
 * src/*: added timings to the verbose output.
 * src/parseForest/ambi-tables.c: removed counting from default behaviour.

Thu Sep 27 13:10:43 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/parser/parser.c: removed the GSS garbage collection code and added it
   to gss/gss.c. I also changed the status bar output to only report on the 
   characters being parsed, and not the end-of-string symbol.

Tue Sep 25 15:11:56 CEST 2007 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * sglr.pc.in: added src/parser and src/parseForest to uninstalled CFlags

Tue Sep 18 15:23:35 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/parser/parserStatistics.h: added conditional count macro and more
   stats.

Tue Sep 18 14:26:33 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/parseForest/filters.c: optimized the priority filter; fewer nodes get 
   created now.

Tue Sep 18 13:34:30 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/parseForest/filters.c: added extra statistics for parse tree nodes
   created.

Thu Sep 13 13:44:30 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/parseForest/filters.c: removed code for filtering of RN constructed
   parse forests.
 * src/*: collecting data for more histograms.
 * src/parser/parserStatistics.h: introduced more macros for efficiency.

Wed Sep 12 15:28:37 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Record the maximum number of ambiguities in an ambiguity cluster, and
   collect information for a histogram of cluster size.

Wed Sep 12 13:40:15 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/commandLineInterface.c: added filename arguments to the statistics and
   debug options of SGLR.
 * src/parser/parserStatistics.c: stopped using logging.h. Opening and closing
   of files is done locally.
 * src/inputStringBuilder.c: fixed closing of file.
 * src/parseTable/parseTableBuilder.c: fixed opening and closing of files.
 * src/*: removed some debug code. This will have to be redone later.

Tue Sep 11 12:07:36 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * test/terms/Sdf2.asfix2.org: regenerated with the new table generated
   earlier today.
 * test/regressionTests.sh.src: removed redundant -a option from comparePT.

Tue Sep 11 11:34:01 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * test/tables/Sdf2.tbl: regenerated the parse table for Sdf2 because I think
   it contained errors from an earlier bug.

Tue Sep 11 11:12:39 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/parser/parserStatistics.c: modified print function to produce rscript.

Tue Sep 11 08:55:29 CEST 2007 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * src/Makefile.am: remove -lprofiler and static path to economop

Mon Sep 10 14:02:29 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Merged revisions 23503-23514 via svnmerge from 
   svn+ssh://economop@svn.cwi.nl/sglr/branches/srnglr
   This was done to introduce the statistical analysis into the trunk.

........
  r23503 | economop | 2007-09-05 16:20:10 +0200 (Wed, 05 Sep 2007) | 6 lines
  
   * Implemented the collection of data for the statistical analysis of the
     parsing algorithm. The data for the histograms still needs to be collected. 
   * src/parser/parser.c: the reductionQueue was not being reset after a level's 
     reductions had been processed, resulting in the queue using up too much
     memory.
........
  r23510 | economop | 2007-09-06 15:27:53 +0200 (Thu, 06 Sep 2007) | 5 lines
  
   * intermediate commit...
   * src/parseTable/parseTable.{c,h}: added the maximum production lenght to the
     parse table data structure. It's needed to initialize the histograms used 
     for the statistics.

Mon Sep 10 11:31:17 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Renitialized merge tracking via "svnmerge" with revisions "1-20305" from 
   svn+ssh://economop@svn.cwi.nl/sglr/branches/srnglr

Mon Sep 10 11:28:04 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Reinitialized merge tracking via "svnmerge" with revisions "1-23518" from 
   svn+ssh://economop@svn.cwi.nl/sglr/branches/srnglr

Mon Sep 10 11:19:59 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Attempting to merge the collection of performance statistics from the
   srnglr branch into the trunk. According to the svnmerge manual it is
   necessary to first initialize the merge tracking support on the trunk,
   related to the given branch.
 * Initialized merge tracking via "svnmerge" with revisions "1-23517" from 
   svn+ssh://economop@svn.cwi.nl/sglr/branches/srnglr

Wed Aug 22 17:03:41 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * test/terms/postParsePriorityFilter.ppprio: regenerated because the forest's 
   count of ambiguities was out of date.

Wed Aug 22 16:59:45 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/commandLineInterface.c: typo in usage info.

Wed Aug 22 15:36:36 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/parseForest/filters.c: created an error message for when the filtering 
   removes all parse trees.

Wed Aug 22 14:29:10 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/Makefile.am: moved the sglr directories to the top of the header search
   path (list of -Idir options) so that they are the first that will be 
   searched by GCC. This fixes the error encountered during the compilation of 
   the sglr bundle -- aterm/aterm/list.h was being found instead of
   sglr/src/utils/list.h when compiling sglr.

Thu Aug 16 16:43:19 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * test/erroneousCommandLines: forgot to turn on the injection and preference 
   counting filters. 

Thu Aug 16 16:34:50 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/parseForest/filterOptions.c: switched off the injection and preference
   counting filters by default.
 * test/termCommandLines: switched on the injection and preference counting
   filters for the old regression tests. We should generate some new tests
   that test the new default behaviour.

Thu Aug 16 16:03:21 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * test/termsCommandLines: changed the cyclic regression tests so that the 
   injection and preference counting filters are switched off. These filters
   do not work correctly on cyclic trees! If an ambiguous node is encountered
   on the traversal of a 'counting' filter we assume that we have already
   counted all ambiguous branches (as filtering is done from the bottom up) 
   and therefore each branch must have an equal number of injections. As an 
   optimization we only traverse one of the branches. However, if the 
   ambiguous tree has a cyclic branch then the assumption does not hold and
   the filtering results depend on the order of the children of an ambiguous
   node. This caused the mdj.cycle regression test to fail in pgen.
 * test/terms/bi.asfix2.org: regenerated with the injection and preference
   counting filters switched off.

Wed Aug 15 15:16:49 CEST 2007 <{kooiker,storm}@cwi.nl>
 * src/Makefile.am: added sglr_la_LIBADD variable to let libtool resolve
   symbols defined in external libraries.
	
Fri Jul 13 15:58:49 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/parser/parser.c: the wrong api function was being called. Fortunately 
   it was accessing the correct argument in the ATerm!

Fri Jul 13 11:59:23 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Made the "count number of ambiguities independent of position information"
   option a MAIN option. I'll probably make this the default behaviour and
   remove the option.

Fri Jul 13 11:10:05 CEST 2007 <{economop,kooiker,oktener}@cwi.nl>
 * src/parseForest/filters.c: Add function to count ambiguities independent
   of position in tree.

Fri Jul  6 13:35:58 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/inputString.c: if an input string is empty and IS_isEndOfString() is 
   called then ATtrue is returned.

Thu Jun 21 14:16:52 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/parser/parser.c: changed the use of the forActorDelayed to match the 
   algorithmic description in Eelco's thesis. State nodes that are created by 
   rejected reductions now get added to the forActorDelayed and are only 
   processed once all nodes in the forActor have been processed. This fixes 
   the bug that resulted in some valid parse trees being incorrectly rejected. 
   However, this approach still results in some invalid parse trees not being
   filtered during parsing that get filtered in the post parse traversal.
 * test/grammars/TooManyTreesRejected.def: added regression test to ensure
   the reject bug that resulted in too many trees being filtered is not
   re-produced.

Tue May 15 15:51:37 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/commandLineInterface.c: fixed bug that prevented the -f flag from
   switching all filters off.
 * src/parseForest/filterOptions.c: tidied up code.

Mon May 14 16:59:44 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/parseForest/filters.c: removed some redundant checks on filtering
   options and fixed some places that filtering was done without correctly 
   checking the filtering options first. This should result in
   less trees being incorrectly filtered (removed) when certain filtering
   options are turned off (I think the reject filter continued removing trees
   even if the reject option was turned off). Presumably this will also improve 
   the performance of the filtering slightly.
   I'm planning of introducing some regression tests with different filtering
   options set. I'll use those tests to ensure that the filtering is correct. 
 * src/parseForest/filterOptions.c: when the -f flag is set all other filters
   are turned off. This makes the check during parsing more straight forward.

Wed May  9 19:04:14 CEST 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * src/parseForest/filters.c: reverted the code on unrolling cycles,
   which was experimental. Next time, we'll do it on a branch :-)
 * src/parseForest/filters.c: fixed a bug in the representation of cycles.
   Maximal innermost sharing does not work when you have cycles. The reason
   is of course that the identity of a tree containing a cycle is not
   defined by its children alone anymore. The bugfix turns off sharing
   for all levels that have a cycle in them. 
   WARNING: this may slow down the parser again, since we used a naive
   way of storing/retrieving which levels have cycles. To be improved
   probably by using a more efficient data-structure.

Tue May  8 10:13:32 CEST 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * src/parseForest/filters.c: fixed an incompatibility with previous
   versions. The indirect preference filter checked for user defined
   injections only, while previous versions checked for all injections.
   Since this version is to be fully backward compatible, I've have 
   changed it back. Also added some comments and optimized one
   test by taking the more easily computed inverse.

Thu May  3 13:54:28 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/parseForest/filters.c: implemented unrolling of cyclic parse forests.
 * src/parseForest/filterOptions.{c,h}: added unrolling of cycles as a 
   filtering option. It is turned off by default.
 * test/*: added new regression test.

Tue Apr 24 13:39:35 CEST 2007 <{economop,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
 * src/parseForest/filters.c: fixed the indirect preference filter. An
   assert was added checking a precondition (both tree being appl's before
   we get a prod from them). This assertion indeed failed. Added a test
   for the case when one of the trees is a character.

Tue Apr 24 11:25:02 CEST 2007 <{kooiker,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
 * restorebrackets: fixed a major bug, restore brackets generated
   illegal asfix for the brackets trees! 
 * Version of SGLR is 4.0 since the last merge.

Wed Apr 18 15:07:06 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/parseForest/filters.c: fixed null pointer exception.

Mon Apr 16 14:11:23 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Fixed parse table error handling for toolbus invocations.
 * test/erroneous/true.asfix2.org: regenerated because the error message 
   changed slightly due to the above fix.

Mon Apr 16 11:21:42 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * test/regressionTests.sh.src: added -x option to the command line arguments.

Fri Apr 13 12:01:53 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/parseForest/filters.c: added memoization to the ambiguity count
   traversal. The count now gives the number of ambiguities in the maximally
   shared representation of the parse tree.

Thu Apr 12 15:36:17 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/parseForest/filters.c: added an extra traversal of the final parse tree 
   to count the number of ambiguous nodes. This is a temporary fix to get 
   the asf-checker working again...

Tue Apr  3 11:51:40 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/parseForest/filters.c: corrected preference count filter. It's
   behaviour was changed during the refactoring which resulted in some 
   ambiguities (the asf equations of the Sdf2-Normalization) not being
   filtered correctly.

Wed Mar 21 11:07:34 CET 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * src/{toolbusInterface.c,sglr.idef.src}: reintroduced possibility to
   activate preference counting and injection counting filters with an
   option in the ToolBus interface script to SGLR. This is needed for
   backward compatibility when parsing equations.

Tue Mar 20 13:44:26 CET 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/parseTable/parseTable.c,parseTableBuilder.c: tidied up ATwarnings.

Tue Mar 20 13:35:28 CET 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * test/regressionTests.sh.src: tidied up script.

Thu Mar 15 16:06:44 CET 2007 <{economop,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * restorebrackets/src/restorebrackets-main.c: fixed incorrect merge

Wed Mar 14 15:17:46 CET 2007 <{economop,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * Merged sglr-refactored branch into the trunk.

Wed Mar 14 14:14:34 CET 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Removed the java directory.

Tue Mar 13 13:27:01 CET 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Changed the TODO c-comments to doxygen \todo comments.

Mon Mar  5 13:56:05 CET 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/gss/shiftQueue.c: the shift queue was implemented as a stack and not a
   queue. This resulted in the GSS state nodes being processed in a different
   order to what was done on the trunk version of sglr. This caused the 
   parse-time reject filtering to break, which in turn caused the post-parse 
   filtering to do more work. We implemented the shift queue as a queue and
   noticed a ~1% speed-up for the SDF grammar example. Unfortunately this 
   "worst case" behaviour cannot be prevented in the general case, but at 
   least the behaviour of this branch is now consistent with the trunk.
 * src/gss/reductionPath.{c,h}: added a print function to aid debugging. 

Fri Mar  2 11:14:49 CET 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/sglr-termstore.{c,h}: added forgotten term-store code.

Thu Mar  1 19:57:55 CET 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/Makefile.am: added CPPFLAGS option to use the fast (macro) api's.
 * src/gss/gssNodeList.{c,h}, src/gss/gssEdgeList.{c,h}: rewrote getHead() and
   getTail using macros which results in an ~4% speedup. Including the small
   (~1%) saving that we made by introducing macros into apigen we are now 
   slightly faster than the trunk version of sglr that still uses PIC! 
   Unfortunately, we are still ~14% slower than the trunk without-pic, but this 
   will hopefully disappear if we introduce more macros into apigen.

Mon Feb 26 15:37:59 CET 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/parseForest/filters.c: introduced a term store from asc-support to 
   avoid reversing the children of a tree during the priority filter. This 
   results in a 3% speedup. (I forgot to add the term-store code in this
   check-in. I did it later...)

Mon Feb  5 17:38:25 CET 2007 <{economop,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
 * Merged revisions 21189-21203 via svnmerge from 
   svn+ssh://economop@svn.cwi.nl/sglr/branches/sglr-reject-postparse
   This was the refactored filtering done in the srnglr branch.
 * src/*.c: after profiling we reimplement the OPT_ options library,
   and removed ambtracker. We also reimplemented the way we analyze
   injections, and removed all uses of lookupLabel. Altogether this
   accounts for 70% time savings. We are still optimizing though...
 * Reimplemented the code and data structures that are used to determine if a 
   production is an injection or not. Removed lookupLabel(), which was only 
   used in the injection filtering, and reimplemented the production lookups. 
   This resulted in a significant speedup.
 * src/utils/list.{c,h}: introduced macros for expensive functions found in
   the profiling.
 * src/utils/memoryManagerGenerator.h: changed so that 2 pools are used:
   - new_pool, where the memory is freshly allocated;
   - reuse_pool, where the memory is freed and then reused.
   The reuse pool allows the optimisation of not protecting the address of
   reused ATerms. This made a huge saving in memory consumption ~200MBs!
   Also, malloc now uses a reference parameter to returns 0 if the memory was
   re-used and 1 if not.
 * src/sglrInterface.c: changed the initial ATerm table size and Afun class
   size. We need to allow the user to do this on the command line. This may
   now not be necessary because of the improvements made during profiling.
 * src/gss/gssEdge.{c,h}: introduced counting of the edges created in the GSS.
   This is debug code, and should be hidden. However, initial experiments show
   that the number of edges created differ in this branch from the trunk --
   slightly worrying...but it could just be an error in the counting.

Fri Feb  2 11:34:40 CET 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * src/sglr.c: added code to increase heap size etc of ATerms.

 * Added even more comments and documentation.

Wed Aug 30 16:47:14 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Added comments.

Tue Aug 29 16:57:52 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Added a new filter flag, -t, that only performs direct preference filtering.    Only one of the (in)direct preference filters can be performed, not both.
 * Added comments.
 * Added a regression test (PostParsePriorityFilter) that triggers the bug in 
   the post parse filtering of priorities. I corrected the term used in
   the regression tests manually.
 * Re-wrote the post-parse priority filtering as the previous implementation
   did not work correctly in certain circumstances (see previous message).
 
Tue Aug 22 14:01:28 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Located bug in |priorityFilter| which prevents the post parse filtering of 
   priority conflicts separated by injection chains with more than one nested 
   ambiguity cluster. Still needs to be refactored.
 * Corrected behaviour of main filter flag.
 * Updated the filtering names in the usage information.
 * Corrected handling of filter on start symbol option.
 * Removed #inAmbs parameter from filterTreeRecursive as is not used.

Wed Jun 28 17:39:37 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Corrected the sglr handling of options in the commandLineInterface and 
   toolbusInterface.
 * Added comments to |filters.c|.

Tue Jun 27 15:18:41 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * configure.in: added AM_MAINTAINER_MODE.
 * Makefile.am, doc/Makefile.am: corrected the doc generation.

Fri Jun 23 16:49:19 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Refactored names in |filters.c|.
 * Added comments.
 * Changed eagerness flags in |filterOptions| to preference.

Fri Jun 23 09:46:50 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Changed restoreBrackets to use the newly refactored sglr.

Thu Jun 22 17:48:14 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Moved functions from |filters.c| to |MEPT-utils.c| and |parseTable.c|.

Thu Jun 22 16:10:52 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Added files |filterStats.{c,h}| that were forgotten in previous commit.
 * Corrected errors in |filters.c|, which were introduced during the previous 
   revision's refactoring, that caused the TestCobol regression test
   to fail.
 * Added check for NULL tree before trying to create and return a parse tree 
   in FLT_filterTree(). This caused an assert to be triggerred for the Reject 
   regression test.
 * Reviewed comments and made function names consistent in |filters.c|.

Wed Jun 21 18:18:13 CEST 2006 <{jurgen,economop}@cwi.nl>
 * We refactored all of |filters.c| which caused changes in |parser.c| and 
   |ambi-tables.c|, among other files. The TestCobol regression test fails. It
   appears to not filter an avoided tree. Probably an error in 
   SG_FilterArgsRecursive(). We'll comment further tomorrow ;-)

Tue Jun 20 18:24:36 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Added doxygen comments.
 * Partly refactored function names in |filters.c|, specifically renaming all
   instances of eagerness to preference.

Tue Jun 20 16:30:40 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Refactored all counting from |filters.c| to the new file |filterStats.c|.
 * Renamed the 'eagerness' counts to 'preference' counts.
 * As a result of the separation of counting from |filters.c| the dependency
   from |ambi-tables.c| was removed.

Tue Jun 20 14:41:06 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Refactored the ambiguity count counter and accessor functions.

Tue Jun 20 13:32:41 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Replaced SG_A_PROD() with api function.

Tue Jun 20 13:27:32 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Replaced SG_A_NR_ARGS() with api function.

Tue Jun 20 13:18:52 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Removed the |state| typedef and refactored all code that used it to use an 
   int instead.
 * Replaced SG_A_STATE() with api function.

Tue Jun 20 10:47:17 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Added Doxygen comments to |inputString.c| and |inputStringBuilder.c|.
 * Refactored |inputStringBuilder.c| by moving the allocationn and
   deallocation of the input string to |inputString.c|.
 * Removed charInCharClass() from |inputString.c| and used function in
   MEPT-utils.
 * Refactored recursive definition of checkLookahead() to an iterative
   definition.
 * Use PTBL api for the checking of lookahead reductions.
 * Regenerated Follower.tbl in the regression tests to use the new style 
   lookahead reductions.

Fri Jun  9 14:45:16 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Added Doxygen comments to files in the src directory. Not everything is 
   documented yet, but it's a start!
 * Added the new docs directory to svn. It contains the configuration and
   mainPage files of Doxygen. I set the svn:ignore property so that the
   generated html and latex directories are ignored.

Thu May 18 14:02:39 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Updated parse tables in regression tests to use the apified version of
   pgen:
   - Action2.def: declared undeclared sorts
   - AmbiRules.def: declared undeclared sorts
   - Casl.def: removed unused sorts and declared undeclared sorts. However,
   there are still some unresolved problems: Qual-Pred-Name is used, but
   undefined; and there is an "inconsistent right-hand side in priorities" on
   line 398 col 4: "(" Term ")" -> Simple-Term. This grammar is probably not
   correct Casl, but I have not changed it since it caused a lot of errors in 
   earlier versions of SGLR.
   from the 'real world' I didn't fix these two issues.
   - Expression.def: uses an "illegal attribute: non-assoc" on line 85, col 1
   and line 29. This also was not changed since it may cause unexpected
   behaviour.
   - Prefer.def: declared undeclared sorts, but ImportSet is still undefined.
   I left this so as not to change the behaviour of the regression tests.
   - Risla.def: removed unused sort and declared undeclared sorts.
   - RobsReject.def: Added Main module.
   - SimpleCobol.def: removed unused sort. There is a bug in sdf-checker that
   causes the final module in this grammar to be missed. This results in the
   error 'undefined symbol used on line 220, col 4: Str'
   - TestCobol.def: declared undeclared sorts.
   - Added the new SDF2 grammar and replaced the old table the parse table.

Tue Mar 28 16:46:16 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Changed makefile to easier debugging of ATerms.
 * Initialised the parse table error list.

Fri Mar 17 15:47:37 CET 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Fixed makefile dependecies in restore brackets.

Fri Mar 17 15:08:18 CET 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Using the statistics logging in the |c-library|.
 * Removed |files.{c,h}| and |rsrc-usage.{c,h}| from utils.

Fri Feb 17 16:05:54 CET 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * |parseTable.c| and |parseTableBuilder.c| now use the new api in 
   |ptable-support|.

Tue Feb 14 13:03:27 CET 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Continuing apification of |parseTable.c|. This is the commit before 
   changing the api of ptable-support.

Mon Feb 13 14:28:47 CET 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Intermediate commit during apification of |parseTable.c|.
 
Fri Feb 10 17:45:51 CET 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Apified most of |parseTableBuilder.c|.

Fri Feb 10 14:05:23 CET 2006 <{economop,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * Fixed bug in |parser.c| which incorrectly caused an "eof unexpected" 
   parse error.
 * Corrected ptable-support substitution variables in |configure.in|.

Thu Feb  9 15:24:20 CET 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Added macros to prevent |mainOptions.h| from being included multiple
   times.
 * Created |initializeSGLR()| in |sglrInterface.c|.
 * Added check to see if SGLR has already been initialized.
 * Added an assert to |SGLR_parse()| to check whether the aterm library has 
   been initialized.
 * Moved the flattenning of the parse tree from the |commandLineInterface.c| 
   and |toolbusInterface.c| into the |sglrInterface.c|.
 * Refactored restorebrackets to use the new version of SGLR.
 * Added missing dits tests to the makefiles in |test|.

Mon Feb  6 11:41:25 CET 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Separated |inputString.{c,h}| into |inputStringBuilder.{c,h}|, 
   |inputString-data.h|, |inputString-api.h| and |inputString.c| to
   encapsulate the implementation in a nicer way.
 * Installed the |inputStringBuilder.h| and |inputString-data.h|.
 * Moved utils/options.{c,h} to config-support so that it can be used by other 
   tools.
 
Wed Feb  1 14:36:59 CET 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Extracted the parse table database and building from |parseTable.c|. 
   Created new files |parseTableDB.{c,h}| and |parseTableBuilder.{c,h}|
 * Have begun using the ptable-support library.

Thu Jan 26 15:55:20 CET 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Refactoring implementation of internal parse table structure:
   - changed names of files |parse-table.{c,h}| -> |parseTable.{c,h}|
   - rewrote most macros to functions
   - removed dead code
 * Removed macros.h
 
Tue Jan 24 17:53:40 CET 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Reformatted parse-table.c.

Tue Jan 24 14:51:03 CET 2006 <{economop,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * Modified |restorebrackets-main.c| to work with SGLR.

Tue Jan 24 13:05:38 CET 2006 <{economop,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * SGLR now uses the shared ATerm library.
 
Mon Jan 23 15:15:09 CET 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Changed the toolbus interface in |sglr.idef|.

Mon Jan 23 12:03:39 CET 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Incorporated handling of cyclic parse forests in the filtering.
 * Added new filter: 'Remove cycles' under the '-fc' option. If the filter is 
   active, all cycles are removed from all ambiguity clusters. The default 
   setting is off.
 * Moved regression tests |bi.cycle| and |mdj.cycle2| from test/erroneous to 
   test/terms as cycles in the parse forest no longer cause errors.

Mon Jan 16 17:07:35 CET 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Intermediate commit for handling of cycles in the filtering. 
   Still need to add PT_makeTreeCycle(). 
   New files created:
   - parseForest/levels.{c,h}
 * If the input string is created with IS_createInputStringFromString then the
   path is set to |_noPath_|.

Thu Dec 22 15:14:09 CET 2005 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Errors are now created with the use of ErrorManager. A summary is 
   created that contains a list of errors so regression tests have been updated.
 * Updated true.nss regression test.
 * Changed regress-terms.sh.src to notify if atdiff fails and error-diff 
   succeeds.
 * Added |slgr.c| and refactored the main function into it with support for
   toolbus invocation of parser.
 * Changed messages passed back to the toolbus to |parse-succeeded| and 
   |parse-failed|. A successful parse contains a parse tree or forest and
   possibly an error summary if the ErrorOnAmbiguity flag is set. A failed
   parse only contains an error summary.

Fri Jul 22 17:06:44 CEST 2005 <{economop,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * Added |reverseList| function to |list.c|, |GSSNodeList| and |GSSEdgeList| 
   to aid debugging.
 * Refactored function and variable names to be consistent.
 * Renamed the following files:
   - sglr-interface.c  -> sglrInterface.c
   - sglr.h            -> sglrInterface.h
   - sglr-main.c       -> commandLineInterface.c
   - tool.c            -> toolbusInterface.c
   - tool.h            -> toolbusInterface.h
 * Added commandLineInterface.h
 * Renamed the type |parse_table| -> |ParseTable|.
 * Renamed |sglrInterface.c| functions:
   - SGopenLanguageFromTerm() -> SGLR_setParseTable()
   - SGopenLanguage()         -> SGLR_loadParseTable()
 * Added ptable-support to configure.in
 * Changed the type of the parse table that is passed into SGLR: 
   |ATerm| -> |PTBL_ParseTable|.
 * Created inputString.{c,h}. 
    - No longer append '\n' to input string. This was an error that caused the 
      Reject regression test to fail with an incorrect error ('\n' unexpected
      instead of eof unexpected).
    - Hid implementation of inputString.
    - Moved |SG_CharInCharClass| |SG_checkLookAhead| (used by the reducer 
      with lookahead) from parser to input string.
    - '\0' is only considered as a valid token if the input string is 
      created via the public functions |createInputStringFromBytes| or 
      |createInputStringFromFile|.
    - Moved positional info from parser to inputString.
 * Added more details of success and failure of individual regression tests 
   to |regress-terms.src.sh|.
 * Updated Reject regression test after above InputString fix.
 * Removed the '\n' printed at the end of the result.
 * Changed format of error messages.
 * Extracted filtering, yielding and cycledetection from SG_parse and added it
   to sglrInterface.
 * Added path to internal parsetable datastructure to help creating error 
   messages. 
 * r.rjct test fails because of the rejections done at parse time. They  killed
   the tree and caused an eof parse error. By doing the postparse filtering we
   get a NULL tree instead.
 
Thu Jun 30 14:28:11 CEST 2005 <economop@cwi.nl, jurgenv@cwi.nl, kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * Moved all |#define| definitions from src into temporary 'macros.h'.
 * Removed getopt.h, getopt.c getopt1.c and addded #include <unistd.h> instead.
 * Removed the #ifdef and #indef WIN32 uses.
 * Removed the long options from regress-terms.sh.src.
 * Removed -m flag which was the inverse of the -2 flag
 * Moved default values of options to topical initializeDefaultOptions functions.* Removed -b flag, which was the inverse of the -t flag
 * Usage information prints the real default values, instead of the current
   values.
 * Renamed forest.[ch] to filters.[ch]
 * Added forest.h which contains the definitions of tree and forest
 * Put printStatusBar in utils/statusBar.[ch]
 * Took include of parse-table.h from sglr.h
 * Moved definitions of parse-table and forest types to parse-table.h
   and forest.h respectively


Thu Jun 30 14:16:27 CEST 2005 <economop@cwi.nl, kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * Changed configure.in to represent new directory structure.

Thu Jun 30 13:13:42 CEST 2005 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Moved sglr.h in src/Makefile.am to include_HEADERS.
 * Modified other Makefiles to find the headers of new files listed below.
 * Refactored configuration options out of sglr.h and created the following 
   files:
   - utils/options.c 		  utils/options.h
   - mainOptions.c      	  mainOptions.h
   - parseForest/filterOptions.c  parseForest/filterOptions.h
   - parser/parserOptions.c  	  parser/parserOptions.h


Wed Jun 29 09:47:12 CEST 2005 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Made the naming convention of variables and functions consistent.
 * Added ATerror messages when no more memory can be allocated.
 * Updated comments.

Tue Jun 28 15:24:51 CEST 2005 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Refactored sglr directory structure:
   - created src directory to store all source files used in sglr. The src 
     directory contains the sglr interface files, the sglr library (libsglr.a)
     and five sub-directories listed below:
     1) gss 
	 Extracted entire GSS data structure (stack.c) and all searching and 
	 accessing functions (parser.c). All memory management and garbage 
	 collection was also separated (stack.c & parser.c).

	 The files included are listed below:
	  gss.c,                  gss.h
	  gssNode.c,              gssNode-api.h, gssNode-data.h 
	  gssEdge.c,              gssEdge-api.h, gssEdge-data.h 
	  gssNodeList.c,          gssNodeList.h
	  gssEdgeList.c,          gssEdgeList.h
	  gssGarbageCollector.c,  gssGarbageCollector.h 
	  reductionPath.c,        reductionPath.h
	  shiftQueue.c,           shiftQueue.h

     2) parseForest
	 ambi-tables.c,           ambi-tables.h
	 forest.c,                forest.h
	 
     3) parseTable
	 parseTable.c,            parseTable.h
     4) parser
	 parser.c,                parser.c
     5) utils
	 bitmap.c,                bitmap.h
	 getopt.c,                getopt.h
	 list.c,                  list.h
	 marking.c,               marking.h
	 - 			  memalloc.h
	 -                        memoryManagerGenerator.h, 
	 posmap.c, 		  posmap.h
	 rsrc-usage.c,		  rsrc-usage.h

     Each sub-directory contains its own makefile and non-installed libraries 
     to allow compilation.

 * Moved libsglr.a (the installed library for sglr) and sglr (the binary 
   executable) into the src directory.

 * Removed libsglr directory.

 * Removed sglr directory.

 * Created this changeLog file to allow easier merging of branches when the 
   refactoring is complete.

Tue Jun 21 09:29:17 CEST 2005 <{economop,kooiker,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
 * Commit before restructuring directory structure.
	
Fri Jun 17 16:02:55 CEST 2005 <{economop,kooiker,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
 * Factored out GSSNode and GSSEdge from GSS
 * Standardized functionnames in GSSList 
 * libsglr/{GGSList.c,GSSEdge.c,GSSNode.c}: Factored out all memory management
   code that contained smart tricks for preallocation and reuse of memory.
   Four instances changed to one local implementation.
   Deobfuscated the implementation, and then wrapped it in a macro such
   that type safe instantiations can be generated for each new struct.
   The macro is called GenerateMemoryManager and has a number of type
   arguments.

Wed Jun 15 17:45:37 CEST 2005 <{economop,kooiker,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
 * Refactored stack.c into GSS, GSSMemoryManagement and GSSList
 * Refactor variable names into descriptive names
 * Added comments in memory management
 * Corrected memory leak 
 * Removed GENERIC_POOL_ALLOC

Tue Jun 14 18:30:33 CEST 2005 <{economop,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * libsglr/stack.c: 
   - refactored stack data type to GSSNode
   - refactored link data type to GSSEdge

Tue Jun 14 12:56:44 CEST 2005 <{economop,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * libsglr: 
   - extracted ReductionPath and ShiftQueue data structures from parser.c
	
Wed Jun  8 15:45:15 CEST 2005 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * libsglr/parser.c:
   - commented out application of reject productions in the parser.
 * test/Robs*:
   - created regression tests for RobsReject.def grammar.
 * test/grammars/Flat.def:
   - Removed Layout module, it isn't used
	
Tue Mar 15 13:57:38 CET 2005 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Bumped version to 3.13 since sglr links to a much changed
   version of libmept (no more flattening of lexicals and layout).

Wed Dec  1 13:24:18 CET 2004 <markvdb@cwi.nl,kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * Fixed the handling of illegal parse tables, closes bug #406.

Sun Oct 24 11:48:15 CEST 2004 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * package:
   - bump version to 3.12.1 as 3.12 was apparently already
     released (says daybuild)
 * libsglr/parse-table.c:
   - fix variable declaration not at the beginning of a block

Fri Oct 22 11:42:47 CEST 2004 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * libsglr/parse-table.c:
   - fix SG_addParseTableErrorError did not deal with a NULL path.
     This happens when it is invoked by the Meta Environment, as
     opposed to commandline.

Sat Aug 21 16:46:32 CEST 2004 <markvdb@cwi.nl>
 * Fixed a bug in the reporting of non existing start states.
 * Regenerated the test.

Fri Aug 20 10:39:07 CEST 2004 <markvdb@cwi.nl>
 * Fixed a small bug wrt reading in parsetables.

Tue Aug  3 10:05:01 CEST 2004 <{kooiker,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
 * libsglr/parse-table.c: added protect of global list of errors,
   and more calls to initialization function for this list of errors.
 * restorebrackets/src/main.c: added call to initErrApi();

Thu Jul 15 15:49:40 CEST 2004 <markvdb@cwi.nl>
 * Introduced the Error-api for the situation the parse table
   could not be processed because:
   - wrong version
   - not a valid parse table
   - parse table does not contain a start state.
 * Added a test for the latter case.

Fri Jul  9 15:12:11 CEST 2004 <markvdb@cwi.nl>
 * Removed every left-/right-/assoc-/non-assoc-prio.
 * Increased the parse table version number to 6.
 * Regenerated all tests and adapted the corresponding
   grammars, because start-symbols were missing. 
   Regenerated some tests because attributes are no longer 
   quoted.

Fri Jul  2 10:20:58 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Bumped to 3.12

Mon May 17 15:07:52 CEST 2004 <{markvdb,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
 * Introduced priorities on specific arguments as a filter.

Tue Apr 27 17:26:14 CEST 2004 <markvdb@cwi.nl>
 * Restore brackets improved with respect to the interaction
   between left/right/non-associativity and priorities.

Mon Apr  5 10:45:46 CEST 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * change error-handling in sglr and update erroneous tests accordingly
 * remove debug-spam in sglr-main.c

Tue Mar 23 09:24:25 CET 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * libsglr/parser.c, restorebrackets/src/restorebrackets-main.c:
   Updated wrt to new MEPT API

Wed Mar 10 09:47:15 CET 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * Use new Error API

2004/02/17 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Fixed the regression tests.

Tue Feb 10 15:27:49 CET 2004 <m336@cwi.nl>
 * upgrade auto* to: autoconf 2.59, automake 1.7.9, libtool 1.5.2

2004/02/09 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Regenerated sglr.tif.c with new const char * arguments and transitively
   closed all compiler warnings. No real problems detected!

Mon Feb  2 16:43:59 CET 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * fix Makefile.am to get "distcheck" working

2004/01/20 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * First version of clickable error messages.

2004/01/14 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Cleanup of interface and first steps towards using error api.

2004/01/12 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added dependency on error-support
 * Bumped version to 3.11
 
2004/01/06 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Simplified the TB interface of SGLR. A parse request contains
   directly the parse table.

2003/11/21 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Brought up-to-date with pt-support, libconversion and libasfix2 
   are now part of libmept.
 * Refactored sglr-interface and sglr-main such that ATBpack is not used
   in sglr-interface anymore. Note that in sglr-interface there seems
   to be to much knowledge about communication with the ToolBus. libsglr
   should not know anything about the context in which it is applied!

2003/10/08 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Reverse the list of ambiguities, fixed bug #55.

2003/10/01 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Removed the '-n' flag and everything related to this.
   The detection of eagerness attributes remains as it was.
   If two trees have the attributes at the top they are
   directly compared, otherwise it is checked whether they
   only differ in one branch, if so, this branch is inspected.

2003/08/08 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Removed some dead code.

2003/08/07 ({jurgenv,markvdb}@cwi.nl)
 * Fixed a bug wrt to filtering of rejects, somehow the position
   information was not updated and thus in case a rejected tree
   was in an ambiguity cluster the position information got 
   out of sync during filtering.
 * Bumped in to version 3.10.2.
 * Regenerated one of the Casl tests.
 * The assert on rejected productions is only activated when
   SG_FILTER && SG_FILTER_REJECT are active.

2003/08/01 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Fine-tuned the way user-defined injections are treated.

2003/08/01 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Set version to 3.10.1

2003/07/30 (markvdb@cs.vu.nl)
 * Fixed the injection bug reported by Albert Hofkamp.
   Added the corresponding regression test.

2003/07/24 ({markvdb, jurgenv}@cwi.nl)
 * Improved the bug fix of 2003/07/23. Finally understood the
   problem, which is not caused by the combination of ambiguities
   and cycles, but by the fact that the optimalization introduced
   to inspect ambiguity clusters only once. This optimalization
   causes the position information to be out of sync, which eventually
   leads to not finding ambiguity clusters down the road.

2003/07/23 (markvdb@cs.vu.nl)
 * Fixed a serious bug wrt the combination of ambiguities and
   cycles.

2003/07/02 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Release 3.10

2003/06/26 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)

 * LGPL license

2002/11/22 (vandenbr@loria.fr)
 * Removed the check that a preferred/avoided subtree occurring in both
   trees are not counted as preferred/avoided when counting nested
   preferred/avoided subtrees.

2002/10/29 (vinju@loria.fr)
 * Removed implicit generation of ToolBus interfaces. *.tif.[ch] are
   now in the repository and in the distributions

2002/10/16 ({vandenbr,vinju}@loria.fr)
 * Fixed two bugs in restore-brackets tool.

2002/09/18 (vandenbr@loria.fr)
 * The -c option (switch cycle detection off) does no longer imply
   switching of filtering as well.

2002/09/16 (vandenbr@loria.fr)
 * Treatment of eagerness and injections improved, jumping
   over injections stops as soon as an (un)eager node is 
   found. This bug was discovered by Robbert de Haan.
   
2002/08/07 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Rolled back the special treatment of keywords.
 * Ambiguous parse-tree are now returned as ordinary AsFix2ME trees
   to ToolBus.

2002/08/05 (jong@cwi.nl)
 * Improved check for stacks which are in 'keyword-lookup' mode.

2002/08/01 (vandenbr@loria.fr)
 * Improved the (efficient) treatment of keywords.

2002/07/31 (jong@cwi.nl)
 * Refactored shift-tuple data structure.

2002/07/31 (vandenbr@loria.fr)
 * Bumped to version 3.9beta.
 * Started working on an improved treatment of keywords.

2002/07/24 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Release 3.8

2002/06/25 (vandenbr@loria.fr)
 * Fine tuned the eagerness filter.

2002/02/28 (vandenbr@loria.fr)
 * If there are more than SG_TOO_MANY_AMBS (10000) ambiguities
   SGLR generates an error messages and stops.

2002/02/13 (vandenbr@loria.fr)
 * Bumped to version 3.7beta

2002/02/07 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Release 3.6

2001/12/21 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Improved ambiguity reporting of sglr's -v switch a bit.
   Still not optimal ;-(

2001/12/17 (vandenbr@loria.fr)
 * SGLR ignored the non-assoc attribute when processing the
   parse table.
 * Added basic functionality to enable restoring of brackets.
 * Bumped to version 3.6beta.

2001/11/25 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)

 * extended functionality of program-check.m4 macros

2001/11/13 (jong@cwi.nl)
 * Cleaned up ChangeLog
 * Released version 3.5

2001/11/07 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Version number introduced in the parse table format.

2001/11/01 ({jurgenv,markvdb}@cwi.nl)
2001/10/31 ({jurgenv,markvdb}@cwi.nl)
 * Fixed a bug with respect to storing filtered ambiguity clusters.
   
2001/10/30 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
 * Makefile.am: added program-check.m4 to EXTRA_DIST variable
 * Makefile.am: removed ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS

2001/10/30 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * BitMap introduced to mark that for a specific position a
   ambiguity cluster was created.
 * Performance back to normal.

2001/10/29 (jurgenv@cwi.nl, markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Replaced SG_MARK and UNMARK by an ATermIndexedSet implementation.
 * Marking only ambiguity clusters when detecting cycles.
 * Completely refactored the code for ambiguity clusters (markvdb).
 * The changes of the last days fix a major bug in sglr; sharing of ambiguity
   clusters caused ambiguities to occur in terms were there are no ambiguities
   due to lexical or context-free restrictions.
 * NOTE: SGLR is now quite a bit slower! 
         A smarter implementation of the current bugfix is needed.
 * NOTE: SGLR can yield different parse trees than previous versions 
         because there are less ambiguities. This effect can be expected
         for grammars that are highly ambiguous (e.g Casl, Island Grammars).
 * The regression tests for Casl have been updated.

2001/10/25-26 (jurgenv@cwi.nl,markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Added position information to the ambiguity cluster table in order
   to make ambiguity clusters unique.
 * Links and paths are extended with a length field.
 * During cycle detection and filtering the position information
   is updated.

2001/10/11 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
 * Changed order of EXTRA_DIST files

2001/09/27 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Due to some changes in the pt-support package, sglr now emits different
   parsetrees in both AsFix2 and AsFix2me. The changes are about the
   attributes of a production. See the ChangeLog of pt-support for details.
 * NOTE: the new parse tree format is not backward compatible.
 
2001/09/21 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added -u switch to dump-productions (unparses the productions).

2001/08/31 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Version 3.5beta.
 * Improved (I hope you are never sure in life) the prefer/avoid
   count filter. Only unique occurences are taken into account.
   This means that a subtree with a preferred/avoided production
   which occurs also in the other tree is not counted.

2001/08/28 (jong@cwi.nl)
 * unused static function outcommented to satisfy gcc-3.0.1

2001/08/20 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Added an option (-A) to treat an ambiguity as an error.
 * Removed option (-P) for adding position information.

2001/08/09 (markvdb@cwi.nl, jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * MultiSet calculation removed, replaced by a simpler
   Avoid/Prefer counting mechanism.
 * Renamed MultiSetCounting to PreferCounting.
 * Reshuffled some code.
 * Wrote alternative InjectionCounting code, not yet activated.
 * Improved the DirectEagerPrefer code (looks through injections).
 * Improved the FilterReject code, rejects are inspected before
   the actual filtering kicks in.
 * Added a new test case.
 * Adapted a number of grammars in order to be prepared for
   a new injection count strategy.
 * Fixed some bugs in the regression test grammars.
 

2001/08/01 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Bugfix; topsymbols were always reports as [undefined].

2001/07/25 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Moved all tree2dot functionality to pt-support package.
 * Removed sdf1tosdf2 tool (did almost nothing).
 * Removed unused client & server frontends for sglr

2001/07/25 ({jong,markvdb,olivierp}@cwi.nl)
 * Added Prefix term to test suite
 * Moved Sdf2.sdf to test/terms dir.

2001/07/24 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * ambtracker functionality and tool moved to pt-support package

2001/07/20 ({jong,markvdb,olivierp}@cwi.nl)
 * Adapted for new parsetable format (marginally more compact)
 * Regenerated parsetables accordingly
 
2001/07/17 (jong@cwi.nl)
 * version 3.3 released, bumped to 3.3.1

2001/07/13 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Bug fix: if all ambiguous nodes disappear, then return
    NULL.

2001/07/12 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Bug fix: a single node is never ambiguous, so "amb" removed!

2001/07/11 (jong@cwi.nl)
 * patched Makefile.am's to comply with new location of -lATB.

2001/07/11 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Bug fix in dealing with filtering over injections. Sometimes it
    stopped in a non-application node.

2001/07/09 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Fixed a bug in yielding the parse tree, it is possible, that
    due to filtering the parse tree becomes empty and thus a
    parse bug is discovered.

2001/07/06 (jurgenv@cwi.nl, markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Removed AsFix1 stuff and AsFix2ME is now the default output
    of SGLR.

2001/07/04 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Propagation of NULL trees was not correctly handled.

2001/06/27 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Repaired a bug detected by Peter Mosses with respect to priorities,
    implemented what is described in Section 4.5.1 (Priority Conflicts) in
    Eelco's PhD thesis.

2001/06/13 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Removed PosInfo related code.
  * Removed BOEHM related "if-def"s.
  * Fixed a protection bug of the reject/prefer/avoid attributes.

2001/06/12 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Changed size of state and label into int (was short).

2001/05/23 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Released version 3.2.2, and bumped into 3.2.3.

2001/05/21 ({jurgenv,markvdb,jong}@cwi.nl)

    can not be disambiguated.
 
2001/05/11 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Added Set, Perm, Numbered iterator, and Function.

2001/05/04 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Added pair symbol.

2001/05/03 (jong@cwi.nl)
 * version 3.2.2
 * cleaned up all Makefile.ams that caused "make install" to rebuild
   (=recompile) due to wrong -I include paths.
 * removed JS legacy ("crippled platform" remark erased)

2001/04/23 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
  * Increased version number to 3.2.1

2001/04/23 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
  * Fixed library search-paths in ./dump, ./client, and ./ambtracker

2001/03/27 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * added six options to libsglr. Each option toggles the use of
    a specific disambigation filter.

2001/03/22 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Fixed a serious bug in filtering of assocativity. 
    Revealed by the following grammar (by Peter D. Mosses):

    module AN-Full

    imports Layout

    exports
      sorts Action Yielder DataOp

    context-free syntax
      Action Yielder          -> Action

      "give" Yielder          -> Action
      "give" DataOp           -> Action
      "skip"                 -> Action
      Action "then" Action    -> Action {left}

      "it"                    -> DataOp

      Action                  -> Yielder
      DataOp                  -> Yielder
      Yielder "then" Yielder  -> Yielder {left}       

2001/03/15 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Fixed a bug concerning the filtering of trees containing "rejects"
    - New filter introduced which compares two trees and selects
      the one without any rejects (if any).
  
2001/02/27 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Fixed location of parsetree libraries 

2001/02/22 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Introduced the "-m" option to generate AsFix2ME.
  * SGLR is no longer dependent on the "old" asfix library.
  * New version (3.20 of SGLR.

2000/12/14 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Re-implemented the "no parse tree contruction" option, however
    in a slightly different way. No nodes are constructed, and in
    FindPaths the list of sons is neither constructed.

2000/12/14 (markvdb@cwi.nl, olivierp@cwi.nl, jong@cwi.nl)
  * Simplified actiontable implementation
  * Counting avoids and prefers filter improved.
  * New version (3.1) of SGLR.

2000/11/17 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Several (serious) memory leaks fixed.

2000/11/08 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
    * ambtrakker renamed to ambtracker

2000/11/04 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
    * Bug fix: of by one error in SG_ReadFile (sglr-interface,c)
      which caused sglr to dump core when reading from standard input  is
      fixed.

2000/10/18 (jurgenv@cwi.nl, markvdb@cwi.nl)
  - Major revision of SGLR!
    * Filtering is moved from shifting/reducing phase to a postprocessing
      phase.
    * All filtering code completely refactored.
    * Efficiency of cycle detection is improved.
    * Efficiency of filtering improved.
    * Position information yielded by AmbTracker has been corrected.
    * Remove a lot of dead and obscure code.
    * New filter added: associativity filter.
  - Bumped into version 3.0!       

2000/10/02 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * A major oversight in filtering fixed:
    - Nested ambiguity clusters were ignored during filtering.
      This caused the "eager" list behaviour of Ernst-Jan Verhoeven!
    - The fix involved also an runtime check on cycles.
      Perfomance penalty has still to be figured out.
  * Bumped version to 2.40

2000/9/27 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Fixed a bug in the lookahead when operating in ToolBus mode.
  * In case of ToolBus mode or stand-alone mode the same buffer
    is being used. Some code has become obsolete and is removed.

2000/9/18 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
  * All file references in sglr-stats.txt are now quoted

2000/8/25 (jong@cwi.nl)
  * In verbose mode, animated counter is only displayed if stderr is a tty.

2000/8/09 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Fixed a major bug that caused sglr to dump core while reading parsetables
    in some infrequently occurring cases.
  * Added prettyprinting of ambiguous productions
  * Bumped version to 2.39
  
2000/8/01 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Fixed a major bug that caused sglr to throw away ambiguities
  * Bumped version to 2.38

2000/7/28 (jong@cwi.nl)
  * In verbose mode, sglr prints which token-# it is parsing/shifting.

2000/7/12 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
   * "char *L" replaced by "language L" where "language" is a typedef ATerm.
     L is used as key in the parsetable database.

2000/7/12 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
   * Bug fix in libsglr/sglr-interface.c. SGparseStringAsAsFix2 used ATBpack
     to pack the complete parse term which caused pattern matching in
     sglr/sglr.idef to fail.

2000/7/11 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
   * Bug fixed in regress-test/grammars/Makefile.am which caused make dist
     to fail

2000/6/28 (js@cwi.nl)
   * Cycles are reported with expanded productions rather than production
     numbers

2000/6/28 (js@cwi.nl)
   * Bumped version to 2.36
   * Refactored forest yielding/ambiguity tracking code: ambiguity
     tracking is now cleanly separated
   * Added `ambtrakker', a command-line tool that conveniently lists
     ambiguities found in AsFix2; by adding a ToolBus interface to
     this tool, a modular disambiguator (sort of) could be provided
     in a Meta-Environmant that uses AsFix2 for exchange format
   * Added version reporting to tree2dot

2000/6/27 (js@cwi.nl)
   *  Bumped version to 2.35
   *  Implemented ambiguity collection code: when asked to return AsFix1,
      a parse error is now generated that includes a list of pairs
      in which for each ambiguity, its position in the input
      term as well as the relevant productions are included.  An example
      (prettyprinted for your convenience):

         module Amber
         exports
           sorts A B
           lexical syntax
            [a]+ -> A
            [a]+ -> B

      js:p5@dek[275]> print -n "a" | sglr -p Amber.tbl -t1
      parse-error([character(256),line(1),col(1),char(2)],
                  ambiguities(1,[ambiguity(position(0),
                                 productions(prod([cf(opt(layout)),
                                                   cf(sort("A")),
                                                   cf(opt(layout))],
                                                  sort("<START>"),no-attrs),
                                             prod([cf(opt(layout)),
                                                   cf(sort("B")),
                                                   cf(opt(layout))],
                                                  sort("<START>"),no-attrs)))]))
      sglr: error in -, line 1, col 1: cannot represent 1 ambiguity

2000/6/23 (js@cwi.nl)
   *  Fixed a tiny bug in sglr's handling of follow restrictions
      of levels deeper than 1
   *  Added the Follower language, and both an offending and a
      non-offending input term w.r.t. the follow-restrictions
   *  Bumped version to 2.34

2000/5/15 (js@cwi.nl)
   * Extended the SGLR API documentation to cover greater detail
   * Fixed a case of usage of uninitialized AFun (that broke the daily build)
   * Implemented a routine that returns the available start symbols,
     available through both ToolBus as well as the public API
   * Bumped the version number (now at 2.32)

2000/5/13 (js@cwi.nl)
   * Documented (pod) the SGLR API
   * Cleaned up function naming to strictly use thepublic vs. private
     convention; accordingly, several cleanups/reshuffles in bits
     containing public routines especially

2000/5/04 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
   * sglr -l now also displays number of reductions per token

2000/4/05 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
   * Removed doc/a2toa1.pod because it now lives in the separate asfix
     distribution
   * manual pages are no longer stored in section 7 but in section 1
