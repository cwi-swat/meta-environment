%% This grammar triggers the post parse priority filtering that is required
%% when a node with a priority conflict is separated from the ambiguity
%% it can resolve by more than one injection chain that is separated by more
%% than one nested ambiguity. 
%%
%% The string to parse is "a*a+a". This test should confirm the following:
%% 1) the filtering is done completely for injection chains,
%% 2) the filtering does not remove the tree for Y "+" Y -> B which does not
%%    have a priority relation.
%%
%% This test should be parsed with injection filtering switched off.
