This is the README file for the SGLR distribution.


Installation instructions:


 * Prerequisite tools

   To compile this distribution you will need the following items:

    -- GNU make, from <http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html>
    -- the common development utilities typically existent in a basic
         UNIXish environment.


  * Optional items

    The following items provide (optional) extra functionality, or
    enable alternative builds.

    -- the Boehm Garbage Collector, available at
       <http://reality.sgi.com/employees/boehm_mti/gc.html>.
       Make as appropriate for your system; install the resulting `gc.a'
       as libgc.a in an appropriate place and install `gc.h' in an
       appropriate include directory.
       With Boehm GC installed, sglr's `..-gc' compilation targets can
       be used (read parser/Makefile.in if interested).  It should be
       noted that even the term `experimental' is a euphemism at best,
       when using it in reference to to BoehmGC versions of the sglr
       parser.
       Hence, strict disclaimers about operating heavy machinery and
       controlling thermonuclear facilities and devices most certainly
       apply here.


* Platform support

     The SGLR parser has been installed successfully on the following
     platforms:

     -- Sun Solaris/Sparc >= 2.5, Sun Solaris/iX86 >= 2.6
     -- SGI IRIX/Mips >= 5.2
     -- NetBSD/PowerPC, NetBSD/iX86 >= 1.4
     -- Mac OS X Server/PowerPC >= 1.0, Mac OS X/PPC >= DP2
     -- LinuxPPC/PowerPC >= 2.0, MkLinux/PowerPC 3.0, Linux/iX86 >= 2.0


  * Dependencies

    The SGLR distribution depends on some other distributions.  Using
    CVS, you can get these distributions as follows (assuming you have
    an account at CWI.  External distribution will be available at a
    later stage):

    -- cd to the directory just above sglr (sglr/..)
    -- issue the following commands:
         $ cvs -d gondel.cwi.nl:/ufs/gipe/CVS checkout aterm
         $ cvs -d gondel.cwi.nl:/ufs/gipe/CVS checkout toolbus
       (and, if you hadn't done so already)
         $ cvs -d gondel.cwi.nl:/ufs/gipe/CVS checkout sglr

    You should now have a directory containing the `aterm', `toolbus'
    and `sglr' directories.  If so, then everything is set up for
    configuration and compilation.


  * Configuring and compiling: final installation

    Let's assume the `aterm', `toolbus' and `sglr' directories are
    all located in a directory `/some/path'.  We also assume that
    the `make' command is in fact GNU make (you may have use `gmake' or
    `gnumake', depending on your site's configuration).  Furthermore,
    you should make sure that your java installation's setup is correct,
    and that your CLASSPATH variable points to the Java classes that
    came with your JDK.

    Here is the basic set-up.  These commands are the minimal config
    options for the Meta-Environment to compile.  Note that the order
    of execution is significant.  This will install everything in the
    directories /some/path/{bin,lib,include}.

    Make sure that your PATH points to the above /path/to/meta/bin
    directory, for instance by typing:

      $ PATH=/some/path/bin:${PATH}; export PATH

    for the sh family of shells, or alternatively (for csh-ish shells):

      % setenv PATH /some/path/bin:${PATH}

    If there are no configure files in the sub-directories: toolbus, aterm,
    and new-met, please run autoconf to generate the configure file in each
    of these sub-directories.

    Then proceed as follows:

      $ cd /some/path
      $ cd toolbus
      $ ./configure --prefix=/some/path --with-java
      $ make install
      $ cd ../aterm
      $ autoconf
      $ ./configure --prefix=/some/path
      $ make install
      $ cd ../sglr
      $ ./configure --prefix=/some/path --with-toolbus=/some/path
      $ make install

    At this point, everything should be configured, compiled, and
    installed.  Once you have added the path to the directory
    /some/path/bin to your PATH (see above), you are all set up.


    The SGLR developers wish you wads of parsing joy; and may all your
    trees amply bear fruit.
