SGLR Scannerless Generalized LR parser

This package contains among other tools a scannerless generalized LR parser. 
The parser is instantiated by giving it a parsetable. The parsetables for SGLR are typically generated by the SDF2 parser generator, which is available
at http://www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv.

The output of a succesfull parse is a parse tree in one of the following
formats: AsFix1, AsFix2 or AsFix2me. Libraries and descriptions for these three
formats are available from http://www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv in the
PT support package.


Installation Instructions
=========================

1) Required packages.

   -GNU make, available from:
      www.gnu.org

   -The ATerm library, available from:
      www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/

   -The pt-support library, available from:
      www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/
 
   Before building SGLR, you should first install these packages.       

2) Configuring SGLR.

   Assuming that the aterm library and  the pt-support library
   are installed in <aterm> and <pt-support> respectively and 
   that SGLR should be installed in <sglr> then the following 
   command will configure sglr accordingly:

   ./configure --prefix=<sglr> --with-aterm=<aterm> \
               --with-pt-support=<pt-support> 

   Note. Default behaviour of configure is that it will look for libraries               in <prefix>/lib and for executables in your search paths. So,                   you do not need to specify the locations of all these packages                  explicitly (as we did in the example above). 

   If you use gcc, sglr is built with "gcc -Wall -g -O2". If you prefer
   different options use --with-cflags="<options>" when you run configure.

   ./configure --help gives a detailed list of configuration options.

3) Building SGLR.

   Assuming that GNU make is called "gmake" on your system then the
   following commands will build and install SGLR:

   gmake
   gmake install 

4) Checking SGLR.

   SGLR can be tested via:

   gmake check

5) Bug reporting and support.

   Please report bugs via:

6) Known bugs.

   None.
