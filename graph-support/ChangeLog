 * Renamed dot-adapter to layoutgraph
 * Removed tree2dot because it is obsolete. It can be simulated by
   tree2graph | graph2dot. TODO: fix the bug that the graph is
   displayed upside-down.
 * Refactored layoutgraph to split into graph2dot and the rest
 * Added edge direction as an attribute to the graph format
