 * utils/tree2graph: The representation of cycles changed in AsFix, it now 
   has a number that denotes the length of each cycle. We use this number 
   to construct an edge that points up (length - 1) nodes in the tree.
 * utils/tree2graph: When mapping a tree to a graph that contains a cycle,
   but the cycle is not complete (because a partial tree was selected) we
   print a dummy node to explain what happened.

Wed Nov  9 09:59:05 CET 2005 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Changed Graph.adt to use lists.
 * Regenerated Java api
 * Regenerated C api and adapted the corresponding code.
 * Added support for ranking of nodes 
 * Used support for ranking in tree2graph to put all character leaves
   of a parse tree on a single level.

Mon Aug 15 15:08:29 CEST 2005 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * configure.in:
   - add libtool support

Tue Jun  7 17:23:04 CEST 2005 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Reversed production for stmt_list to use left instead of right
   recursion such that large graphs can still be processed.

Mon May 30 15:40:08 CEST 2005 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Added support for drawing cyclic trees

Thu Jan 20 14:58:49 CET 2005 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Added support for seeing the shared representation to tree2graph

Wed Dec  8 09:30:17 CET 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * lib/Makefile.am:
   - Add graph-${VERSION}.jar to EXTRA_DIST 

Mon Nov 29 10:33:03 CET 2004 <{jurgenv,jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * Execute 'dot -y' now, to flip coordinate system such that Swing
   can deal with it better.
 * NOTA BENE: we no depend on the '-y' switch of graphviz's dot, which
   does not appear in all released versions of graphviz.
 * Bugfix: half of the edge coordinates were inverted depending on dots
   ideosynchrasies. Now we build the edge coordinates in the same fashion
   for all edge types (s,e,whatever)

Fri Nov 26 15:19:11 CET 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Removed flipping an edge in layoutgraph, somewhere else this
   bug must be solved now ;-)

Fri Jun 18 10:32:42 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Added dependency on aterm-java in .pkg file

Mon Jun 14 09:32:01 CEST 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * prepend gc to graph-converter messages
 * implement "get-node-origin" in tree2graph for now.
   To be moved when we generate graph.idef from graph.adt

Thu Jun 10 10:12:28 CEST 2004 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * lib/Makefile.am: explicitly refer to graph*jar in top_srcdir/lib

Tue May 25 16:10:55 CEST 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * add generation of java graph API

Fri Apr 16 11:45:51 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Improved tree2graph on the character level

Fri Mar 19 08:39:10 CET 2004 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * graph-support/utils/layoutgraph/dot.y:
   #define YY_NO_UNPUT to suppress generation of static yyunput() function

Wed Mar 10 09:16:28 CET 2004 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * Use new error-api 

Tue Feb 10 15:27:49 CET 2004 <m336@cwi.nl>
 * upgrade auto* to: autoconf 2.59, automake 1.7.9, libtool 1.5.2

Mon Feb  2 16:43:59 CET 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * fix Makefile.am to get "distcheck" working

Mon Jan 26 11:55:29 CET 2004 <{jong,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
 * bump version to 0.2

2003/01/13 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added dependency on error-support package

Wed Oct  8 16:14:39 CEST 2003 <{jong,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
 * Added support for color, fillcolor and style attributes. Closes: #64
 * utils/tree2graph: arbitrary colors used to draw attention to ambiguities.

Thu Oct  2 13:19:41 CEST 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * utils/layoutgraph/dot.y:  Closes #54
   - #define YYERROR_VERBOSE to get better error message
   - relaxed dot parser, an identifier can also start with a digit now
   - changed yyerror message a bit

Thu Sep 11 12:47:17 CEST 2003 <jong.cwi.nl>
 * graph-support:
   - mv layoutgraph.idef -> layout-graph.idef
   - mv tree2graph.idef -> graph-converter.idef

2003/08/01 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Set to version 0.1.1

Wed Jul 23 10:31:02 CEST 2003 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * graph-support/utils/layoutgraph/layoutgraph.c:
   function layoutGraph() rewritten from scratch, without using fork/exec.
   Since we were using /tmp/XYZ files anyway just use system() to invoke dot.

2003/07/14 ({jurgenv,markvdb}@cwi.nl)
 * Added graph attributes to the graph format
 * Added reading of bounding box information from dot format
 * Fixed a major (but subtle) bug in the conversion from dot to graph. If
   and edge is an 'e' edge, the nodes must be reversed in order for the
   Bezier algorithm to be able to work correctly.
 * Fixed another bug in layoutgraph, multiple edges with the same beginning
   and end node were lost due to the merging. We have removed the merging,
   edge attributes of the incoming graph are lost from now on!

2003/07/09 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Removed explicit ShowSource information.

Thu Jul 10 15:33:16 CEST 2003 <{jong,markvdb,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
 * utils/tree2graph/PT2graph.c:
   "Show Source" adapted to new button format

2003/07/09 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Limited the number of nodes in the graph to MAX_NR_OF_NODES (3000)!

2003/07/03 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * tree2graph takes a (module) name as argument and uses this in
   the "ShowSource" message.

2003/07/02 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Release 0.1

2003/06/26 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added package definition file

2003/06/27 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Extended the graph format with a generic info container (key,value).
 * Position information, if any, is now stored in the parsetree graph
   as well.

2003/04/24 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * In ToolBus mode layoutgraph will produce a graph with productions
   as nodes (it used to be just the symbols)

Fri Apr 11 13:37:01 CEST 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * fix #include problems

2003/04/02 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Extended dot parser with the ability to deal with direction attributes
   on edges
 * This means also extending the parser to deal with 4 curve points instead
   of 5 curve points and the corresponding dot way of encoding this information
   in a string.

2003/03/31 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Renamed dot-adapter to layoutgraph
 * Removed tree2dot because it is obsolete. It can be simulated by
   tree2graph | graph2dot. TODO: fix the bug that the graph is
   displayed upside-down.
 * Refactored layoutgraph to split into graph2dot and the rest
 * Added edge direction as an attribute to the graph format

2003/03/30 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Fixed SOCKLIBS configuration for SunOs.

2003/03/28 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Started graph-support version 0.1beta
