 * Added support for color, fillcolor and style attributes. Closes: #64
 * utils/tree2graph: arbitrary colors used to draw attention to ambiguities.

Thu Oct  2 13:19:41 CEST 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * utils/layoutgraph/dot.y:  Closes #54
   - #define YYERROR_VERBOSE to get better error message
   - relaxed dot parser, an identifier can also start with a digit now
   - changed yyerror message a bit

Thu Sep 11 12:47:17 CEST 2003 <jong.cwi.nl>
 * graph-support:
   - mv layoutgraph.idef -> layout-graph.idef
   - mv tree2graph.idef -> graph-converter.idef

2003/08/01 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Set to version 0.1.1

Wed Jul 23 10:31:02 CEST 2003 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * graph-support/utils/layoutgraph/layoutgraph.c:
   function layoutGraph() rewritten from scratch, without using fork/exec.
   Since we were using /tmp/XYZ files anyway just use system() to invoke dot.

2003/07/14 ({jurgenv,markvdb}@cwi.nl)
 * Added graph attributes to the graph format
 * Added reading of bounding box information from dot format
 * Fixed a major (but subtle) bug in the conversion from dot to graph. If
   and edge is an 'e' edge, the nodes must be reversed in order for the
   Bezier algorithm to be able to work correctly.
 * Fixed another bug in layoutgraph, multiple edges with the same beginning
   and end node were lost due to the merging. We have removed the merging,
   edge attributes of the incoming graph are lost from now on!

2003/07/09 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Removed explicit ShowSource information.

Thu Jul 10 15:33:16 CEST 2003 <{jong,markvdb,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
 * utils/tree2graph/PT2graph.c:
   "Show Source" adapted to new button format

2003/07/09 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Limited the number of nodes in the graph to MAX_NR_OF_NODES (3000)!

2003/07/03 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * tree2graph takes a (module) name as argument and uses this in
   the "ShowSource" message.

2003/07/02 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Release 0.1

2003/06/26 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added package definition file

2003/06/27 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Extended the graph format with a generic info container (key,value).
 * Position information, if any, is now stored in the parsetree graph
   as well.

2003/04/24 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * In ToolBus mode layoutgraph will produce a graph with productions
   as nodes (it used to be just the symbols)

Fri Apr 11 13:37:01 CEST 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * fix #include problems

2003/04/02 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Extended dot parser with the ability to deal with direction attributes
   on edges
 * This means also extending the parser to deal with 4 curve points instead
   of 5 curve points and the corresponding dot way of encoding this information
   in a string.

2003/03/31 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Renamed dot-adapter to layoutgraph
 * Removed tree2dot because it is obsolete. It can be simulated by
   tree2graph | graph2dot. TODO: fix the bug that the graph is
   displayed upside-down.
 * Refactored layoutgraph to split into graph2dot and the rest
 * Added edge direction as an attribute to the graph format

2003/03/30 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Fixed SOCKLIBS configuration for SunOs.

2003/03/28 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Started graph-support version 0.1beta
