2003/04/02 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Extended dot parser with the ability to deal with direction attributes
   on edges
 * This means also extending the parser to deal with 4 curve points instead
   of 5 curve points and the corresponding dot way of encoding this information
   in a string.

2003/03/31 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Renamed dot-adapter to layoutgraph
 * Removed tree2dot because it is obsolete. It can be simulated by
   tree2graph | graph2dot. TODO: fix the bug that the graph is
   displayed upside-down.
 * Refactored layoutgraph to split into graph2dot and the rest
 * Added edge direction as an attribute to the graph format
