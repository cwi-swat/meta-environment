This is the prototype project, demonstrating intertool communication in a bus architecture (like the toolbus).
This implementation is experimental some might contain some bugs.


Author: Arnold Lankamp.


How to run:
nl.cwi.bus.server.Bus is the main class for the bus.
When this one is running you can connect tools.
A couple of example tools are present in the nl.cwi.client.test package.

If you want a demo, just start the StartTest class the nl.cwi.client.test package.
It will start the bus including several tools (2x receiving, 1x direct receiving and 1x sending).
Just type something in the sending tools textfield and press the button, it will be broadcasted to all the other tools.

The way of communication can be altered by setting the threshold in the nl.cwi.config.Config class.
This threshold will determine whether it will be send directly or through tool intercommunication.
