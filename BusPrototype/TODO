Bugs:
	Connection reset / broken pipe problem.
		This occured very rarely and at random.
		It might have been fixed already, because it may have been associated with a bug that was fixed recently.
		Data could have become lost when the Toolbus was overloaded, causing the wrong data to be seen as a length specification, messing up the operation that we wanted to receive and ultimately causing the connection to be aborted (connection reset).
	
	Ensure 100% compatibility with multiprocessor / core systems.
		-Check if everything is properly synchronized.


TODO:
	Lower CPU usage while writing.
	
	Add support for notes.
	
	Add support for snd-eval.


Features:
	Handle firewall issues (alternate way of communication).


Stuff that might be nice:
	An intergrated tool for diagnostics.
	Should support:
		-Memory stats
		-Runtime stats
		-Thread stats
		-Ability to generate Java code runtime at the Toolbus, for advanced debugging (possible security hole though, so it should be disableable).


Future work:
	Use streams.

	Handle crashing clients (recovery).
