Bugs:
	Connection reset / broken pipe problem.
		This occured very rarely and at random.
		It might have been fixed already, because it may have been associated with a bug that was fixed recently.
		Data could have become lost when the Toolbus was overloaded, causing the wrong data to be seen as a length specification, messing up the operation that we wanted to receive and ultimately causing the connection to be aborted (connection reset).

TODO:
	Lower CPU usage while writing (20% done).
		-Yields properly to ensure we don't take away scheduling time from other processes / threads (DONE).
		-Only iterates when the network output buffer has space.

	Create appropriate terms for sending and receiving messages (DO / EVAL / EVENT) (30% done).	
		Add support for EVAL.
			-Enable the encapsulation of a optional put message inside the ack message, to serve as a response holder.
			-Add support for return messages in the ToolBridge.
	
	Add tree preservation support to the variables; the variable will contain the entire tree and offer access to a node in that tree.
	This is needed on the level of the Toolbus.
	We want to be able to access a specific node, without messing up the GC or retrieving the value.
	
	Add serializable object sharing.
		-Every (non native) node should be uniquely identifiable (this identifier should not be serialized, but has to be reconstructable during deserialization).
		-Create a support for LZW like compression for serialization (if a node has been serialized before, adding only the identifier to the bytestream should be enough; there is no need to re-serialize the entire object).
	
	Add support for serializable object collections.
	
	Add a more advanced method of matching for terms.
		-Enable matches on generic types.

	Add tool identification support.


Features:
	Handle firewall issues.
		-Detect passiveness.
		-Create an alternate way of communication
			-active -> passive (get through the bus).
			-passive -> passive (both get and put(val) through the bus).


Stuff that might be nice:
	An intergrated tool for diagnostics.
	Should support:
		-Memory stats
		-Runtime stats
		-Thread stats
		-Ability to generate Java code runtime at the Toolbus, for advanced debugging (possible security hole though, so it should be disableable).


Future work:
	Use streams.

	Handle crashing clients (recovery).
