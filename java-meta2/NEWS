Version 0.3.3
  * user-manual.ps and exercises.ps are now included in the distribution. 
  * Bug fix: equations of module of which the syntax was changed were not
    made unavailable.

Version 0.2.3
  * Bug fix: in module-db, equations of module of which the syntax
    was changed were not made unavailable. 
  * in-output-tool now ignores duplicate entries in search-path.
  * in-output-tool also requires inodes to be different before complaining
    about duplicate entries. This reduces overzealous complaints involving
    entries duplicated by a soft- or hardlink.
  * Bug fix: closing unparsed equations and syntax definitions
    resulted in module-db inconsistency.
  * Bug fix: deadlock occurred when dumping equations over incomplete
    specifications
  * Restructured {in-output,module-db.tbscripts} so that asf-sections,
    .sdf.baf, .asf.baf, and parsetables are now read/looked up/written
    in the same directory that its respective .sdf file is situated.
  * Fixed a bug with respect initializing structure editors with
    start symbols when tree is already parsed. 
  * relaxed the version checking of wish. If the script is unable to
    check the version of wish, it generates a warning banner. After that
    it assumes the right version is available in the environment.
  * changed the .eqs extension to .asf. The following extensions change:
      .eqs     -> .asf
      .asf.baf -> .eqs
      .eqs.baf -> .asf.baf
      .eqs.tbl -> .asf.tbl
  * added change-eqs-ext tool that does the above renamings for all files
    in a directory.
  * bugfix in config-manager: searchpaths were delivered in reverse order

Version 0.2
  * Release to consolidate changes

Version 0.0.13
  * Online help files are now installed in <prefix>/share/meta
  * replaced --with-tcldot option by --with-graphviz option to make
     configuration more easy.
Version 0.0.12

  * ASF+SDF Meta-Environment is now configured/build using automake
