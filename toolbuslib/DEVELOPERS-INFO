The build process of toolbuslib is controlled by autoconf and
automake (see www.gnu.org).

Before running ./configure to configure the system and to create
Makefiles from Makefile.in's, you should first run ./reconf which
generates among others Makefile.in's from Makefile.am's.

Running ./reconf might give several warnings about non-existent files
which can safely be ignored because automake will install these
missing files for you.

It is essential that you have an up-to-date version of automake
(version 1.4 or above is required).

NOTE.
For building a distribution of the toolbuslib package you need to have
toolbus and idef2tif in your PATH
