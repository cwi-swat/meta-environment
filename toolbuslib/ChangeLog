 * toolbuslib.pc.in: Bumped version to 1.0

Fri Jun  6 09:23:46 CEST 2008 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * toolbuslib.pc.in: removed erroneous dependency on toolbus-ng,
   that made all of SDF dependent on ToolBus!

Wed May 07 12:00:05 CEST 2008 <lankamp@cwi.nl>
 * src/atb-tool.*: Added basic support for the request<->response stuff.
   To guarantee sequential ordering with respect to events, changes were made to the event-queue as well
   (e.g. it was removed since there was no point in having it).

Thu Mar 03 10:19:05 CEST 2008 <lankamp@cwi.nl>
 * tifstoc: Added the tifstoc tool.

Mon Mar 19 09:41:46 CET 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * src/*: adapted to new ATwriteToBinaryString interface

Tue Dec 12 13:19:17 CET 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * src/atb-tool.c: wrapped call to select in ATBhandleAny with a while
   loop. As long as the select was interupted by a non-blocked signal
   we try again. This error popped up while profiling the library, since
   under those circumstances there are more frequent interrupts...

Tue Jul 25 09:16:05 CEST 2006 <{kooiker,jurgenv}@cwi.nl,martin.bravenboer@gmail.com>
 * **: adapted package to use the standard meta-build-env.

 * toolbuslib.pc.in: declares dependencies on system socket libraries

 * **/Makefile.am:
   - Maintainers use ATerm-dbg library

Wed Mar  8 17:13:27 CET 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>

   from the ToolBus first before exiting.

Mon Aug 15 15:08:29 CEST 2005 <jong@cwi.nl>

   - add libtool support

Thu Mar 11 18:42:34 CET 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
* -ltb library from the toolbuslib package is deprecated and was only used 
   inside of the toolbus package. So I moved it into the toolbus package.

Thu Mar  4 13:15:02 CET 2004 <{paulk,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
 * Fixed a nice bug in toolbuslib: uninitialized field of a struct
   for symbols.

Tue Feb 10 17:09:13 CET 2004 <{jurgenv,jong}@cwi.nl>
 * added new ATBinit commandline option: -TB_COLLECT_LOOP <N>
   - if N == 0, then ATBeventloop does not do an AT_collect();
   - if N > 0, then ATBeventloop does an AT_collect after every Nth event. 

Tue Feb 10 15:20:55 CET 2004 <m336@cwi.nl>
