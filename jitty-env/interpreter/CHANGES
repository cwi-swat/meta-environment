Changes from version 1 to version 2
===================================
. error with normalizing in the presence of hashing solved
  by discriminating between toplevel and internal functions:
   - JIT_normalize and normalize; 
   - JIT_assign and assign

. changes in interface:
  - added JIT_flush (in order to clear the hashtable)
  - added "hashing" flag to JIT_normalize

. added 'void' to all functions with 0 arguments
