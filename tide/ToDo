This file contains a list of bugs that need to be fixed and features
that need to be added. Some items contain an indication of their 
importance (priority) and/or an approximation of the effort needed to
fix the bug or add the feature. Needless to say that items with a high
priority that require a modest effort will be tackled first :-)

Prio is a number between 1 and 10, where higher numbers indicate more
urgent items.

Effort is a rough estimate in terms of man hours (h), days (d), or
weeks (w).

For convenience, adapter specific problems/features are also listed
in this file, even though they should probably be listed in the 
the actual adapter implementation.
