This package implements the ToolBus coordination architecture.

The ToolBus is a coordination architecture that supervises
the cooperation of a number of tools (software components).
The tools may be implemented in a variety of programming languages
and may run on different computers. Truly heterogeneous,
distributed, applications can thus be implemented.

The ToolBus is based on two essential concepts: <I>Tscripts</I> and <I>ATerms</I>.
<P>
Tscripts are the scripting language used to describe the coordination of the various tools.
It has the following characteristics:
<menu>
<li> a concurrent language with a solid theoretical foundation: the Algebra of Cooperating Processes (ACP).
<li> primitives for process creation, synchronous and asynchronous messaging.
<li> primitives for starting, terminating external tools and for communicting with them.
<li> strongly typed.
<li> automatic generation of tool interfaces.
</menu>

<P>
ATerms (for Annotated Terms) are a language-independent data exchange format for hierarchically structured data.
Key features:
<menu>
<li> ATerms can represent directed, acyclic, graphs and support <I>maximal subterm sharing</I>.
This means that common substructures are always shared and memory is preserved.
<li> ATerms may contain annotations that are also ATerms. In this way, tools can attach specific information
to ATerms, such as source code location, highlighting and coloring, dataflow, etc.
<li> ATerms have been implemented for C, Java, Perl, Python and other languages.
