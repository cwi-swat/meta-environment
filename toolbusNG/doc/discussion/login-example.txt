Error recovery in the Login example
-----------------------------------


The challenge here is as follows:
(1) Model part of the login process.
(2) There are two tools:
		- the client tool: a user interface for connecting to the system.
		- the authentication tool that checks passwords.
(3) Both tools may crash
(4) Write a script that is robust


The script without error recovery:

tool CLIENT is
...
(
  @snd-msg login(Name?, Password?) {
    } 
    ( @rec-msg login-succeeded . LOGGED-IN
    +
      @rec-msg login-failed
    )

) * delta


tool Authentication is

   @rec-msg login(Name?, Password?) {
   	
   } ( @snd-msg login-succeeded
     + @snd-msg login-failed
     )
     
General analysis
----------------

In the case of remote procedure calls we have the simple situation:

   |
   | ----- call   ---->|
                       |
                       |
   |<----result/-------|
         exception
         
The situation with general messages is that we can have five cases:

(a) all goes well:

   Sender            Receiver

   |-------msg--------->|
   |                    |
   |                    |
   |<------reply--------|
   
(b) sender aborts: tricky case since it changes the normal flow of actions

   |-------msg--------->|
   |                    |
   |                    |
   |------abort-------->|
   
   
(c) receiver aborts: simple case since the occurrence of an abort is just
    another reply to be considered by the sender

   |-------msg--------->|
   |                    |
   |                    |
   |<-----abort---------|  
   
   
(d) sender aborts and then receiver aborts: hard case, since this requires exception handling
    during recovery

   |-------msg--------->|
   |                    |
   |-------abort------->|
   |                    |
   |<-----abort---------|  
   
(e) receiver aborts and then sender aborts: hard case, since this requires exception handling
    during recovery

   |-------msg--------->|
   |                    |
   |<------abort--------|
   |                    |
   |-----abort--------->|  
     

Now try #1 to extend the login example with error recovery for these cases
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

For better understanding, all @ primitives are expanded.
The cases (d) and (e) are not yet handled.

tool CLIENT is
...
(
  rec-event login(Name?, Password?) . snd-msg (Name, Password) {
    } 
    ( rec-msg login-succeeded . LOGGED-IN
    +
      rec-msg login-failed
    +
      rec-msg authentication-aborted	// Authentication tool crashes
    ) >>
    (rec-disconnect .  					// the client tool crashes
    snd-msg client-aborted) .			// inform authentication about it

  snd-ack-event login

) * delta
 
tool Authentication is

   rec-msg login(Name?, Password?) . 
   ( snd-eval (Name, Pasword) .
     (  rec-msg client-aborted . 		// client tool crahes; just consume results of snd-eval
   										// NOTE: this does not fit our @rec-msg {} @snd-msg scheme!
   		(rec-value login-succeeded + rec-value login-failed)
   	
     + rec-value login-succeeded . snd-msg login-succeeded
    
     + rec-value login-failed . snd-msg login-failed
     )   
   ) >>   
   rec-disconnect .						// the authentication tool disconnects
   snd-msg authentication-aborted		// inform client about abort
   Authentication() . 					// restart it (perhaps add max retry counter?)
 
 
 
Try #2 to extend the login example with error recovery (revised)
----------------------------------------------------------------

Starting point is the backtracking operator P1 \+ P2
defined in Bergstra, Ponse and Van Wamel "Process Algebra with backtracking"

Informally, there are two cases
(a) P1 completes normally, i.e. does not result in delta, then
     P1 \+ P2 is equal to P1
(b) P1 reduces to delta, then all side-effects caused by P1 are undone
    and P1 \+ P2 is equal to P2.
    
We will write 
    	try P1 otherwise P2
instead of
		P1 \+ P2
	
Properties and extensions:

(a) When a transaction aborts all processes that are "involved in it"
    (i.e. are connected with it via a snd/rec-msg) are aborted as well.

(b) Conceptually the local state of a process is saved before a transaction
    starts. In case of an abort, the local state is restored.
    
(c) Instead of a delta, failure can also be achieved by fail(T)

(d) A new atom failed(T?) can test for a specific kind of failure.

tool CLIENT is
...
(
  try {
    @snd-msg (Name?, Password?) {
     } 
     ( @rec-msg login-succeeded . LOGGED-IN
     +
       @rec-msg login-failed
     )   
     >>
     rec-disconnect . fail("client")             // local failure: the client tool dies
   } otherwise {							     // try to recreate the crashed tools
    											 /
     failed("Client") . create Client()
     +
     failed("Authentication") . create Authentication()
     											// This is the *wrong* place: CLIENT should not
     											// know about Authentication
   }
) * delta
 
tool Authentication is

   @rec-msg login(Name?, Password?) {
   }
     (  @snd-msg login-succeeded
     + 
        @snd-msg login-failed
     ) 
   >>   
   rec-disconnect .						// the authentication tool disconnects
   fail("Authentication").             // abort
