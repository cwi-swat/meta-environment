Dear Meta developers,

This repository contains specifications for INTERACTIVELY testing
features of the Meta-Environment. The checklist for interactively 
testing it is located at:

http://homepages.cwi.nl/htbin/leon/wiki/wiki?MetaEnvironmentTestCheckList

Directions of use:
 - Please add a subdirectory for every separate specification that somehow
   adds a new challenge to the test suite. 
 - If the challenge can also be expressed as a new module in an existing
   specification (say the pico specification), please do so. The smaller
   the amount of specifications here, the better.
 - Add descriptions of tests and the expected results to the above Wiki page.
 - Test specifications may be (and should be) updated to the latest syntax
   of ASF+SDF, button language etc. 
 - Please take care never to change a specification as a workaround for a bug 
   in the system and commit this change to this repository.
 - Keep the ChangeLog up-to-date

Best regards,

Jurgen Vinju
