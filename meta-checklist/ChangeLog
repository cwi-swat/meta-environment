	* Started repository for specifications that can be used for
	  interactively testing the Meta-Environment
	* Added a README to explain what the goal of this repository is
	* Started a Wiki page at that contains descriptions of the tests:
    http://homepages.cwi.nl/htbin/leon/wiki/wiki?MetaEnvironmentTestCheckList
          (shouldn't this actually be located in this repository?)
	* Added the pico specification as the first test case
