This is the first prototype of the DeFacto Fact Extractor, as described in:

H.J.S.Basten and P.Klint, DeFacto: Language-Parametric Fact Extraction from Source Code, 1st International Conference on Software Language Engineering, September 2008, Toulouse, France.

DeFacto can be used as follows:

Create a file with fact annotations according to the SdfWeaver syntax.
The annotations need to be weaved into an SDF grammar, with the option -w. The result is a term parse table.
This table then needs to be used to parse terms of which facts need to be extracted.
With the -e option (which is the default) facts can be extracted from the parsed term, into an RStore.
