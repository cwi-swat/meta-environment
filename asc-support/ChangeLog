Wed May  7 13:08:29 2008    <bruntink@cwi.nl>

	* asc-support.pc.in: Changed dependency on relation-stores to rstore-support.

Wed Apr 16 11:10:31 CEST 2008 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * lib/Library.*: regenerated with new apigen to fix problems
   with type punned aliasing.

Thu Mar 27 10:23:31 EDT 2008 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>

Sat Dec  1 02:39:41 EST 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * lib/builtin-io.c: added two new builtins for parsing and adding
   position information in one go. Also, the parse errors of files
   now get the correct file name stored in their description.

Thu Nov 29 09:16:04 EST 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * lib/builtin-io.c: fixed another initialization bug. loadParseTable
   did not need SGLR to be initialized before, now it does because 
   the options data structure needs to have been initialized.

Mon Aug 20 17:31:00 CEST 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * lib/builtin-io.c: fixed bug #777, parse_bytes did not initialize SGLR

   fix distcheck.

Thu Mar 15 15:18:32 CET 2007 <{economop,kooiker}@cwi.nl>

 * lib/builtin-io.c: Improved the error reporting done in parse_result.

Tue Sep 19 11:07:01 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Merged r17384-18222 from trunk.

Tue Sep 19 10:54:44 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * We gave svnmerge init an incorrect revision range when the branch was 
   created. This is the correction:
   Initialized merge tracking via "svnmerge" with revisions 
   "0-17383,18223-20254" from svn+ssh://svn.cwi.nl/asc-support/trunk

Mon Sep 18 11:16:23 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Merged r18626-20254 from trunk and updated build environment.

Tue Jun 27 14:43:54 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * package: removed version information from dependencies.

Fri Mar 17 15:53:57 CET 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Added the |c-library| dependecies for SGLR. 

Fri Feb 10 14:10:10 CET 2006 <{economop,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * Fixed loading of parse table in |asc-main| and |builtin-io|.
 * Output error if the parse table is not loaded.
 * Corrected errors in |configure.in| and makefiles.

Thu Feb  9 11:39:33 CET 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Removed some casting.

Thu Feb  9 11:03:26 CET 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Include and use the new interface to SGLR |sglrInterface.h| instead of 
   |sglr.h|.

Fri Jan 26 09:17:01 CET 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * lib/*.h: API CHANGE! toasfix() will return a PT_Tree instead of 
   a PT_ParseTree from now on. To create a PT_ParseTree with default
   surrounding layout and a correct start production use the function:
   PT_ParseTree PT_makeValidParseTreeFromTree(PT_Tree t);
   This changes makes innermost and toasfix eachothers dual, such that
   the way we deal with start injections can be handled outside of these
   functions in a balanced manner.

Tue Dec 26 10:02:36 CET 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * lib/asc-termstore.[ch]: factored out term_store stack data-structure
   for reuse in different functions of the ASF runtime.
 * lib/asc-support.c,asf-muasf2pt.c: (re)use of term_store for all recursions
   over the parse tree structures.
 * lib/asc-support.c: use of term_store temporary arrays for optimizing
   traversal functions. This saves about 5 to 10% running time in 
   'traversal functions intensive' specifications. 

Wed Nov 29 15:57:05 CET 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * lib/asc-muasf2pt.c: fixed Bug #662, the lvalue of an assignment
   depended on the execution of the rvalue of an assigment via a
   reference to a global variable. Between 3.x and 4.x versions of
   GCC the order of execution was changed, triggering this bug.
   We introduced a variable to fix the bug.

Thu Nov 23 19:05:32 CET 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * lib/asc-support*.[ch]: removed dead code that used to support delay
   attributes. Replaced all deprecated use of Symbol with AFun.

Mon Oct 16 11:03:49 CEST 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * asc-support/trunk/lib/asc-muasf2pt.c:
   - unprotected terms need to be set to NULL to prevent funny warnings 
     from the check_term macro in the ATerm library when checking is on. 
     (closes #643)

Thu Oct 12 12:18:56 CEST 2006 <jeroen@bja-electronics.com,jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * lib/builtin-io.c: fixed a number of errors in the construction of
   parse trees of errors that may occur during parsing.

Tue Oct 10 10:48:17 CEST 2006 <{economop,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
 * lib/builtin-io.c: fixed interfacing with sglr to parse bytes.

Thu Jul 27 12:12:06 CEST 2006 <martin.bravenboer@gmail.com>
 * utils/asc-support-config.src: removed asc-support-config
   generation which is obsolete now we are using pkg-config.
	
Wed May  3 13:39:38 CEST 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Bumped version to 2.3

Fri Apr 21 16:44:01 CEST 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * lib/asc-support.c: first support for rewriting ambiguities
   with a compiled specification. All clusters are lifted to
   constructors.
 * TODO: lower ambiguity constructors back to normal amb nodes.
 * amb clusters are memoized to prevent exponential behavior for
   nested clusters. An absolute necessity!

Thu Apr 20 06:05:35 CEST 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * lib/asc-ambiguity.c: added functionality to make ambiguity
   clusters explicit to the runtime environment

Fri Mar 10 11:53:37 CET 2006 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * **/Makefile.am:
   - Maintainters use ATerm-dbg library

Wed Mar  8 14:03:38 CET 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * lib/*: added rudimentary support for rewriting with layout by
   compiled specifications. Currently, this only works for rewriting
   parse trees that do not contain lists.

Wed Jan 18 16:27:48 CET 2006 <{kooiker,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
 * utils/asc-support-config.src: added options --ldflags --includes
   and --prefix to config script, such that transitive dependencies
   may be hidden from users of asc-support.

Thu Jan  5 09:21:01 CET 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Added rudimentary implementation of ciliterals. They are ignored
   like normal literals, and restored with the spelling that is copied
   from the SDF definition (as it can be found in a PT_Symbol).

Mon Aug 15 15:08:29 CEST 2005 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * configure.in:
   - add libtool support

Sun Jun 12 00:15:34 CEST 2005 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * lib/builtin-term-compare.c:
   - Added paramters for modAmbSorting and modLayout to comparePT

Thu Feb 17 16:06:56 CET 2005 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Added possibility for parsing the input and output before
   rewriting.

Fri Jan 21 11:22:04 CET 2005 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Compiled specifications DO NOT REWRITE TRAVERSAL FUNCTIONS when
   they occur in an input term. The reason is for bootstrapping, 
   traversal functions that occur in the left-hand sides of equations
   should not dissappear. Another solution to prevent this is preferable
   of course.
 * Functions that return lists are treated differently now. There used to 
   be a dynamic flattening necessary, not anymore. So "remove_list" has
   been removed from the run-time library.
 * Extended maximum number of argument to a function to 55.
 * muasf2pt: TODO: check completeness of the retrieval of literal trees!
 * lifting and lowering builtins share a cache. The cache that lift builds
   is used for lowering.
  
Mon Dec 27 18:14:42 CET 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Regenerated library API's
 * Many small changes to get structured lexicals online. Most changes are
   a result of changed API's.

Fri Nov 19 15:49:10 CET 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Merged developments of 1.5 to trunk

Fri Nov 19 14:25:28 CET 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Changed dependency on Tide to dependency on small package tide-support.

Tue Nov  2 13:45:14 CET 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl,storm@cwi.nl>
 * Added next-id builtin (returns a new integer every time its called)

Mon Oct 18 22:54:09 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Merged tide builtins from 1.5 into trunk.

Mon Oct 11 14:56:32 CEST 2004 <sgmcorne@science.uva.nl,jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Added ASF builtins that implement a tide adapter.
 * Temporarily added dependency on Tide package, until that package
   is split up into the pieces that are really needed for asc-support.

Fri Aug 27 14:42:20 CEST 2004 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * refactor to use new PT_yield functions in MEPT API

Fri Jul 16 09:25:51 CEST 2004 <markvdb@cwi.nl>
 * Adapted to the new SGLR requirements.

Wed Jul 14 15:12:18 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * ./lib/builtin-anno.c: Added new builtin set-term-anno.
 * Bumped to 2.1

Tue Jun  8 16:45:48 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Bumped to 2.0
 * Added new traversal run-time functions, copies of the originals that can
   detect success and failure of rewriting. This functionality is used by the
   compiled code for traversal functions that have bottom-up, break
   functionality.

Fri May  7 11:19:43 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * 1.8 was released before, so bumped to 1.9 before release

Mon May  3 19:36:50 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Had to bring builtin-io.c up-to-date with all kinds of changes in 
   error-support and sglr.
 * Regenerated CO_ library using the new functionality for dealing with
   parameterized result sorts of builtin functions. ParseResult[[Sort]]
   is returned by the parsing builtins, and the Sort is used for selecting
   the type-correct parse tree.

Tue Apr 27 14:37:06 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * From now on, compiled ASF can deal with annotations!
   - ATisEqual is replaced by ATisEqualModuloAnnotations
   - innermost and muasf2pt preserve annotations
   - asfc has a '-a' option to activate it.
   - gcc must be called with -DASC_WITH_ANNOS to select the correct
     equality implementation.
   - before calling asc_support_main, you must call
     setKeepAnnotations(ATtrue) to make innermost and muasf2pt behave
     properly.
   - TODO: refactor asc_support_main to have an extra argument.
     This is not doable for release 1.5
 * Fixed get_term_anno to return a proper result when no anno is found.

Wed Apr 14 10:53:11 CEST 2004 <m336@cwi.nl>
 * lib/*.c: call SGLR functions with a parsetable, not a "language"

Tue Mar 23 09:39:34 CET 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * lib/*.c: updated wrt new MEPT api

Wed Mar 10 09:58:21 CET 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * Use new Error API

Tue Feb 17 11:53:32 CET 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Added support for choosing the default layout that is inserted
   in a normal form in the toasfix phase. Two convenience functions:
   toasfix and toasfixNoLayout are offered. The first inserts a space
   the second inserts empty layout.

Mon Feb 16 10:26:59 CET 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * term-compare builtin changed to term-less 

Wed Feb 11 15:27:49 CET 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Reactivated memoization. It seems that this feature was #ifndeffed out
   a long time ago!
 * Every compiled specification now has the new commandline option 
   '-s <string>' a -s replaces a -i instead of a parse tree, a string is
   used as input to the rewriter. This string is lifted to a StrCon 
   before rewriting. Typical usage of this functionality include extra
   arguments to a function:
     ./MyCompiledSpec -f myfunction -i myinput.trm -s "hello" -s "optimize!"
 * Removed ToolBus version of asc-support. Every compiled specification
   now depends on ToolBus lib. 
 * NOTE: a different way of dealing with dependencies of compiled
   specification needs to be invented, now every compiled specification
   depends on all dependencies of all builtins....

Tue Feb 10 15:27:49 CET 2004 <m336@cwi.nl>
 * upgrade auto* to: autoconf 2.59, automake 1.7.9, libtool 1.5.2

Mon Feb  2 16:43:59 CET 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * fix Makefile.am to get "distcheck" working

2003/01/06 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * All ASFE builtin functions now have an arity corresponding to the
   arity of the builtin, so we don't have to extract the arguments
   ourselves anylonger.

   toplevel ambiguities).

2003/01/06 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added dependency on error-support
 * Changed builtin-io.c to catch and return all errors that occur
   during IO.
