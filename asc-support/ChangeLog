Tue Jun  8 16:45:48 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Bumped to 2.0
 * Added new traversal run-time functions, copies of the originals that can
   detect success and failure of rewriting. This functionality is used by the
   compiled code for traversal functions that have bottom-up, break
   functionality.

Fri May  7 11:19:43 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * 1.8 was released before, so bumped to 1.9 before release

Mon May  3 19:36:50 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Had to bring builtin-io.c up-to-date with all kinds of changes in 
   error-support and sglr.
 * Regenerated CO_ library using the new functionality for dealing with
   parameterized result sorts of builtin functions. ParseResult[[Sort]]
   is returned by the parsing builtins, and the Sort is used for selecting
   the type-correct parse tree.

Tue Apr 27 14:37:06 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * From now on, compiled ASF can deal with annotations!
   - ATisEqual is replaced by ATisEqualModuloAnnotations
   - innermost and muasf2pt preserve annotations
   - asfc has a '-a' option to activate it.
   - gcc must be called with -DASC_WITH_ANNOS to select the correct
     equality implementation.
   - before calling asc_support_main, you must call
     setKeepAnnotations(ATtrue) to make innermost and muasf2pt behave
     properly.
   - TODO: refactor asc_support_main to have an extra argument.
     This is not doable for release 1.5
 * Fixed get_term_anno to return a proper result when no anno is found.

Wed Apr 14 10:53:11 CEST 2004 <m336@cwi.nl>
 * lib/*.c: call SGLR functions with a parsetable, not a "language"

Tue Mar 23 09:39:34 CET 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * lib/*.c: updated wrt new MEPT api

Wed Mar 10 09:58:21 CET 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>

Tue Feb 17 11:53:32 CET 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Added support for choosing the default layout that is inserted
   in a normal form in the toasfix phase. Two convenience functions:
   toasfix and toasfixNoLayout are offered. The first inserts a space
   the second inserts empty layout.

Mon Feb 16 10:26:59 CET 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * term-compare builtin changed to term-less 

Wed Feb 11 15:27:49 CET 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Reactivated memoization. It seems that this feature was #ifndeffed out
   a long time ago!
 * Every compiled specification now has the new commandline option 
   '-s <string>' a -s replaces a -i instead of a parse tree, a string is
   used as input to the rewriter. This string is lifted to a StrCon 
   before rewriting. Typical usage of this functionality include extra
   arguments to a function:
     ./MyCompiledSpec -f myfunction -i myinput.trm -s "hello" -s "optimize!"
 * Removed ToolBus version of asc-support. Every compiled specification
   now depends on ToolBus lib. 
 * NOTE: a different way of dealing with dependencies of compiled
   specification needs to be invented, now every compiled specification
   depends on all dependencies of all builtins....

Tue Feb 10 15:27:49 CET 2004 <m336@cwi.nl>
 * upgrade auto* to: autoconf 2.59, automake 1.7.9, libtool 1.5.2

 * fix Makefile.am to get "distcheck" working

2003/01/06 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * All ASFE builtin functions now have an arity corresponding to the
   arity of the builtin, so we don't have to extract the arguments
   ourselves anylonger.
 * All parsing builtins provide the requested sort to the parser (to prevent
   toplevel ambiguities).

2003/01/06 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
