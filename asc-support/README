ASF+SDF runtime library

The Library asc-support is a runtime library which is required to
build stand-alone executables from C file generated by the ASF+SDF compiler.  

Installation Instructions
=========================

1) Required packages.

   -GNU make, available from:
      www.gnu.org

   -The ATerm library, available from:
      www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/ 

   -The ASF support library, available from:
      www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/ 

2) Configuring ASF+SDF runtime library.

   Assuming that the aterm library is installed in <aterm> and ASF support
   in <asf-support> and that ASF+SDF runtime library should be installed 
   in <asc-support> then the following command will configure ASF+SDF runtime 
   library accordingly: 

    ./configure --prefix=<asc-support> --with-aterm=<aterm> \
                --with-pt-support=<pt-support> \
                --with-asf-support=<asf-support>

   Note. Default behaviour of configure is that it will look for libraries               in <prefix>/lib and for executables in your search paths. So,                   you do not need to specify the locations of all these packages                  explicitly (as we did in the example above).

   If you use gcc, sglr is built with "gcc -Wall -g -O2". If you prefer
   different options use --with-cflags="<options>" when you run configure.

   ./configure --help gives a detailed list of configuration options.    

3) Building ASF+SDF runtime library.

   Assuming that GNU make is called "gmake" on your system then the
   following commands will build and install ASF+SDF runtime library:

   gmake
   gmake install

4) Checking ASF+SDF runtime library.

   ASF+SDF runtime library can be tested via:

   gmake check

5) Bug reporting and support.
