 * lib/lift.c: added parameter for lifting cache, such that the user can
   provide her own cache for memoization. This is to prevent memory leaks.

Thu Mar 15 15:15:16 CET 2007 <{economop,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * lib/*: regenerated api fixing macro bug
 * lib/{lift,lower}.c: fix errors introduced by missing cilit definition and
 wrong tree cycle definition

 * lib/ASFME.[ch]: regenerated with more brackets around macro arguments
 * lib/{lift,lower}.c: added functionality for sharing the results of lifting
   while lowering. In case nothing happened in between lifting and lowering,
   lowering is the exact inverse operation of lifting.

Thu Mar  8 19:03:58 CET 2007 <{economop,kooiker,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
 * **: regenerated all API's in this package with a new version of 
   ApiGen that generates more efficient code for the is-alternative 
   predicates.
