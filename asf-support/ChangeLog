   aliasing issues.

Thu Mar 27 10:28:15 EDT 2008 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * lib/ASFME-utils.c: little change due to API change in pt-support 

Wed May 30 11:31:57 CEST 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * lib/lift.c: added parameter for lifting cache, such that the user can
   provide her own cache for memoization. This is to prevent memory leaks.

Thu Mar 15 15:15:16 CET 2007 <{economop,kooiker}@cwi.nl>

   while lowering. In case nothing happened in between lifting and lowering,
   lowering is the exact inverse operation of lifting.

Thu Mar  8 19:03:58 CET 2007 <{economop,kooiker,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
 * **: regenerated all API's in this package with a new version of 
   ApiGen that generates more efficient code for the is-alternative 
   predicates.
