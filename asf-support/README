ASF Support

This package contains the largely generated library for handling parsetrees
over ASF syntax. The syntax of terms in ASF is user-defined, so this 
library only contains the fixed parts of the ASF syntax. 

For handling terms in user-defined syntax, use the PT support library.

Installation Instructions
=========================

1) Required packages.

   -GNU make, available from:
      www.gnu.org

   See the file ./package for the dependencies

2) Configuring ASF Support.

   Assuming that the aterm library is installed in <aterm> and
   that ASF Support should be installed in <asf-support> then 
   the following command will configure ASF Support accordingly: 

    ./configure --prefix=<asf-support> 

   Note. Default behaviour of configure is that it will look for libraries               in <prefix>/lib and for executables in your search paths. So,                   you do not need to specify the locations of all these packages                  explicitly (as we did in the example above).

   If you use gcc, sglr is built with "gcc -Wall -g -O2". If you prefer
   different options use --with-cflags="<options>" when you run configure.

   ./configure --help gives a detailed list of configuration options.    

3) Building ASF Support.

   Assuming that GNU make is called "gmake" on your system then the
   following commands will build and install ASF Support:

   gmake
   gmake install

4) Checking ASF Support.

   ASF Support can be tested via:

   gmake check
