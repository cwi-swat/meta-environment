----------------- Bugs: -----------------

When using dump parsetable from actions menu in term editor in
asfsdf-meta env. ToolBus reports "type mismatch in assignment:
Modulename$ButtonActionExecutor:str? := []"
This is properbly due to two StackPopString operations in
button-actions.tb, rec-msg(dump-parse-table, and only one push
operation in standard.asfsdf.buttons.src as in:
  action([description(term-editor, menu(["Actions","Dump ParseTable"]))],
         [push-active-module,
          dump-parse-table]),



SetFocus when parse error occurs is not working when the error is the
result of a single character, due to a mismatch between the area
definition and the set-focus elisp function in
meta/editors/text/emacs/gnu-emacs.el.
The area definition define the start and end to be equal. When this is
true the set-focus functions does not highlight the area, because the
it is designed to highligt areas from and including the start and up
to but NOT including the end! This can be changed by using the
following fix:

(defun set-focus (start end)


  (if (equal start end)
      (setq start (- start 1))
  )


  (setq must-send-modified ())
  (let ((modified (buffer-modified-p)))
    (clear-overlays 'FOCUS)
    (let ((overlay (make-overlay start end nil nil)))
      (overlay-put overlay 'face (get-focus-properties))
      (overlay-put overlay 'category 'FOCUS)
      (overlay-put overlay 'priority 200)
    )
    (set-buffer-modified-p modified)
  )
  (setq must-send-modified t)
)

If start is equal to 1, corresponding to the top left most, it is
still working although start would be set to zero!?!



----------------- To be changed: -----------------
- Open imported modules, when opened, closed and opened again not all
  included modules gets opened. - Pending on bugfix in the meta env.
- ASDF term editor: Dump parsetable. - Pending on bugfix in the meta
  env.
- Popup: Reopen module, nothing seems to be going on  - Pending on
  bugfix in the meta env.
- Popup: Close module, import graph is not updated  - Pending on
  bugfix in the meta env.


- Popup: Export Eqs
- Popup: Export Term parsetable
- Popup: Export Eqs parsetable


- Evaluation of Action Semantic

- Documentation

- Description of concrete syntax in the Action env.
- - Consistency check, maybe a problem when including asf+sdf modules.

- ASDFEditor: TypeCheck

- modulo and division for integers is not supported by asf, maybe it
  should be implemented in the evaluator.

--------------------- Changes: --------------------

Mon, Oct 11
Note:
- asdf-modules.tb.src: Parse*, The second parse is now done before the
  editor shows up. Not tested if reduce and evaluate works, put the
  seems to do all right.



Thu, Oct 07
Note:
- Demo day


Wed, Oct 06
Note:
- Commiting changes to cvs.
- Moved initial bindings from the evaluator to the asdf
- A problem with the way fun is translated has been identified.


Tue, Oct 05
Note:
- Fixed the data constructor issue.
- The fac function ran for the first time!!! COOL!
- Working the ref, !, := operators, the instroduced null-val seems to
be buggy.


Thu, Sep 30
Note:
- Working on fixing the interface issue. Most things seems to work but
the data constructor issue still needs attending.

- asdf-modules.tb.src: ASDF, added pre-get-all-syntax-hook for asdf
  terms. This was needed due to the following bug: if a asdf term was
  opend as the first thing after loading a asdf module and reduced the
  env. would crash.
  When introducing sdf modules in the action env. there is a
  difference between asdf terms and sdf terms!

- meta-interface.tb.src: Meta-Interface, removed the
  pre-get-all-syntax-hook for asdf terms.


Wed, Sep 29
Note:
- Working on fixing the interface issue.

- Included Integers and Tokens in AN


Tue, Sep 28
Note:
- Identified the place where the solution to the following bug lies:
  If the generated asf won't parse, the corresponding asdf module need
  to be opend. This can be done by changing the process GetEditorType
  in editing.tb which is called from EditLocation in button-actions.tb.

- Working on fixing the interface issue.

- asdf-modules.tb.src: ASDF, when receiving a
  generate-asfsdf-for-modules message some info is now being displayed
  so as to let the user know some thing is happing.

- asdf-modules.tb.src: GetEvalInfo, information about which module we
  are currently gathering information from is now being displayed.

- tbscript-mode.el: Update of the syntax highlighting.

Mon, Sep 27
Note:
- Identified some interface problems between the Action Env. and the
evaluator. Fixing is underway.

Sat, Sep 25
Note:
Changes made to
- asdf-modules.tb.src: ASDFButtons, It is now possible to call
  the evaluator from the Action env.

- asdf-modules.tb.src: EvalutateASDFTerm, It is now possible to call
  the evaluator from the Action env.

Fri, Sep 24
Note:

lower-case.

Note:
Changes made to
- asdf-modules.tb.src: SecondParse, correcting the bug from yesterday,
handling the case when GetParseTable returns no-table.

Mon, Sep 20
Note:
Changes made to
- asdf-modules.tb.src: ParseASDF, correcting a bug appearing when
reparsing after a parseerror. Added remove asdf-text to invalidate-asdf-in-db.

  rhs-productions.
  e.g. val ::= booleeean.

Fri, Sep 17
Note:
Changes made to
- asdf-modules.tb.src: ParseASDF, consistent use of invalidate-modules-in-db.

Tue, Wed, Thu Sep 14, 15, 16
Note:
Changes made to
Integrating the evaluator into the Action Env.
- eval.sdf, eval.asf, evaluation-function.sdf,

copied when installing the action package, using mkmeta.

- asdf-modules.tb.src: ASDF, now using the termstore in __ASDF_PT__.

Fri Sep 10
Note:
Changes made to
- Done twisting the sdf and asf modules to make them parse correctly.

Thu Sep 9
Note:
Changes made to
- Twisting the sdf and asf modules to make them parse correctly.

Wed Sep 8
Note:
Changes made to
- process-eqs.tb: GetAsfModule, replaced an occurence of the variable
  Filename with ModuleId, because Filename is no longer being used. This

Mon Aug 28
Note:
Changes made to

  a backup was to be used.



Sat Aug 28
Note:
Changes made to
- standard.asdf.buttons.src: Some rearranging of the buttons in order
  to make the View tree menu item appear in the Actions menu of the term

  parse error in val-or-var.asdf.
