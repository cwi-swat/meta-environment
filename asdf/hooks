---------- New Hooks: ----------
New hooks introduced in the meta-env.
For each new hook, there is a short motivation and a list of files and
process changed in order to implement the hook.


------- termstore-consistency-check-hook -------
Motivation:
When loading an initial termstore as is the case in the ASDF package,
we might not need the consistency check.

- meta/tbscripts/module-utils.tb: TermStoreActivation, added
  termstore-consistency-check-hook.

- asdf/meta-script/asdf-modules.tb.src: ActionSdf-hooks, added
  termstore-consistency-check-hook

- asfsdf/meta-script/meta-interface.tb.src: Meta-Interface, 
  termstore-consistency-check-hook and
  get-modulenames-for-consistency-checking-hook.



------- get-modulenames-for-consistency-checking-hook -------
Motivation:
It might not bee all modules, which should be included in an
consistency check. E.g. if an initial termstore is part of a given
termstore, one might not want to do consistency check of the modules
of the initial termstore, because, they should never change doing the
lifetime of a meta env. distribution.

- meta/tbscripts/module-utils.tb: TermStoreActivation, added
  get-modulenames-for-consistency-checking-hook.

- asdf/meta-script/asdf-modules.tb.src: ActionSdf-hooks, added
  get-modulenames-for-consistency-checking-hook.

- asfsdf/meta-script/meta-interface.tb.src: Meta-Interface, added
  get-modulenames-for-consistency-checking-hook.



------- do-consistency-check-hook -------
Motivation:
How to do consistency check is package dependent. E.g. an ASDF module
should not be checked the same way as an asf+sdf module.

- meta/tbscripts/module-utils.tb: CheckModuleConsistency, added
  do-consistency-check-hook.

- asdf/meta-script/asdf/meta-script/asdf-modules.tb.src: ActionSdf-hooks2,
  do-consistency-check-hook.

- asfsdf/meta-script/meta-interface.tb.src: Additional-Interface,
  do-consistency-check-hook.



------- extra-mod-path-hook -------
Motivation:
We need to be able to locate files outside the current directory and
the asf-library. Furthermore we must avoid collision with files
created by the user.

- meta/tbscripts/button-actions.tb LocateFile, added
  extra-mod-path-hook.

- asdf/meta-script/asdf-modules.tb.src: ActionSdf-hooks, added set-extra-mod-path,
  clear-extra-mod-path, extra-mod-path-hook.

- asfsdf/meta-scripts/meta-interface.tb.src: Meta-Interface, added
  extra-mod-path-hook.



------- get-asf-equations-text-hook -------
Motivation:
The asf generated for the asdf modules should not be saved on the
disk, and therefor we can not use the previous implementation.
We need to load the text from the termstore.

- meta/tbscripts/process-eqs.tb: GetAsfModule, added the 
  get-asf-equations-text-hook.

- asdf/meta-script/asdf-modules.tb.src: ActionSdf-hooks added the
  get-asf-equations-text-hook.

- asfsdf/meta-script/met-interface.tb.src Meta-Interface, added
  get-asf-equations-text-hook.



------- get-parse-equation-checking-hook -------
Motivation:
Since the asf which we generate should be valid under any circumstance
it is not necessary to check it. Therefor we need to be able to disable
the checking option to GetParseTable in ParseEquationsText.

- meta/tbscripts/process-eqs.tb: ParseEquationsText, added the
  get-parse-equation-checking-hook.

- asdf-modules.tb.src: ActionSdf-hooks added the
  get-parse-equation-checking-hook.

- asfsdf/meta-script/met-interface.tb.src Meta-Interface, added
  get-parse-equation-checking-hook.



------- get-open-syntax-parse-handler-hook -------
Motivation:
The choice of syntax parse handler is dependent of the type of module,
which needs to be parsed.

- meta/tbscripts/open-modules.tb: OpenSyntax, use of
  get-open-syntax-parse-handler-hook and 
  get-open-syntax-parse-handler-hook-result(Pid?)

- asdf/meta-script/asdf-modules.tb.src: ActionSdf-hooks, added
  get-open-syntax-parse-handler-hook and
  get-open-syntax-parse-handler-hook-result

- asfsdf/meta-script/meta-interface.tb.src  Meta-Interface, added
  get-open-syntax-parse-handler-hook and
  get-open-syntax-parse-handler-hook-result



------- set-module-syntax-text-hook -------
Motivation:
Which table the module text needs to be saved in is depending on the
type of module.

- meta/tbscripts/open-modules.tb: OpenSyntax, added
  set-module-syntax-text-hook.

- asdf/meta-script/asdf-modules.tb.src: ActionSdf-hooks, added
  set-module-syntax-text-hook.
