This package contains the tool 'ptpretty'.

Description
-----------

It is meant as a case-study. There is no guarantee that it is useful in any
way. A better pretty-printer can be found in the GPP package.

Ptpretty takes an AsFix parse tree and returns a formatted AsFix parse tree.
It only affects the LAYOUT parts of the parse tree. The formatting is done
according to the following scheme:

  - the original SDF definition that was used to generate a parse-table
    is used as input.
  - the way each production in this definition is layouted is stored as
    a pretty-print directive.
  - a single traversal of the tree applies these directives to the parse tree

For example:

  Take an SDF production like this:

context-free syntax
"if" Exp "then" 
  Stat 
* 
"fi" -> Statement

 It will pretty print an if-then expression with a space after the "if"
 and a space after the expression, a newline after the "then", after every
 statement a newline an also after the last to start the "fi" on a new line.

 The statements will be indented two spaces (indicated by the two spaces
 before Stat.

 Nested applications of productions automatically leeds to deeper indentation
 levels.
 
Usage
-----
 
The following commands are necessary to pretty-print a term:

> parse-sdf2 -i mylanguage.def -o mylanguage.pt
> sdf2table -i mylanguage.def -o mylanguage.tbl
> sglr -p mylanguage.tbl -i myprogram.trm -o myprogram.pt
> ptpretty -s mylanguage.pt -i myprogram.pt myprogram.pretty
> unparsePT -i myprogram.pretty -o myprogram.trm
