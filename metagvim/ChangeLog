 * version 0.4.1
 * fixed off-by-one error in focus visualization

Fri Jan 17 11:12:35 CET 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * version 0.4
 * fix "Parse" submenu-item is no longer always in a well-known place,
   sometimes it's "Meta-Environment|Parse", sometimes "Term-Actions|Parse":
   Solution for now (hack): check all incoming menu-items and remember
   the menu-item that introduces the "Parse" submenu-item. This makes
   hitting "ctrl-p" to parse the current file transparent for end-users
   again.
 * add more robust implementation of tb_get_focus_text:
   When parsing (e.g.) empty equations, it is more useful to just report
   that the file is empty, rather than ATerror() with the complaint that
   gvim was "unable to get focus text". Wing it by sending "" as contents.

 * del "edit_text" (was unimplemented)
