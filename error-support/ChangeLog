Wed Mar  3 10:17:29 CET 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Readded jar files to the repository in order to prevent some
   circular dependencies (with sdf-apigen, asf-library, asf, ...)
 * Bumped to version 0.2

   when some timestamp is not correct by accident in a release distribution

2004/02/17 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Added error-diff functionality.

Mon Feb 16 16:37:02 CET 2004 <{jong,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
 * utils/error-support.{c,idef}:
   - add get-summary-first-feedback, get-feedback-first-location,
     get-location-filename

Tue Feb 10 15:27:49 CET 2004 <m336@cwi.nl>
 * upgrade auto* to: autoconf 2.59, automake 1.7.9, libtool 1.5.2

2004/02/03 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Added display functionality.

Mon Feb  2 16:40:44 CET 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * Fix Makefile.am's to get distcheck working

2004/01/29 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Added a ToolBus component for manipulating errors.

2004/01/27 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Added the mapping from parsed errors to abstract errors.

2003/12/18 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Renamed package to error-support

2003/12/16 ({jong,jurgenv}@cwi.nl)
 * Renamed library to libErrorAPI
 * Completed lifting of abstract errors to parsed errors.
 * Added commandline tool for lifting errors (mainly for testing purposes)
 * Added generated jar file with the Java version of the abstract error API

2003/12/15 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Regenerated both APIs using new apigen. 
 * Added lexical definitions of String and NatCon manually to prevent 
   bottom-sort generation in the parsed API (See lib/Lexicals.sdf)
 * started on utility functions for lifting abstract errors to parsed errors
   and vice versa.

2003/12/04 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Initial version 0.1 of meta-errors package. This package will contain
   generated data-structures from basic/Errors and some convenience functions.
   The data-structures are to be used as:
     - a general error description mechanism in the Meta-Environment
     - a reusable error description mechanism for ASF+SDF specifications
 * Started with generated of imploded api and parse-tree api versions of
   meta-error in lib subdirectory
 * Generation of libraries is completely manual: missing bottom-sorts
   NatCon and String are not generated in the parsed api (manual editing
   of ParsedErrors.h solved this problem temporarily).
