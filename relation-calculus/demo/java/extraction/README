1. Extract facts from a given source package. The general format is

	   extract-java sourcedir my.rstore.pt

   where sourcedir contains all the Java source files (possibly in
   subdirectories) and my.rstore.pt is the file that will contain an rstore
   with extracted facts.  The extension .pt indicates that the restore is in
   binary parse tree format, recognized by the tools we use.

   Example:

	 extract-java /home/paulk/software/source/sources/CH/ifa/draw jhotdraw.rstore.pt

   This will take some 3 minutes on a 1 Gig machine for 15 Kloc of souce code.

    If you want to inspect the contents of such a generated file do

	 unparsePT -i jhotdraw.rstore.pt

   and this will give you the extracted data as text.

2. Convert the merged rstore to visualization data:
	rstore2rviz -i jhotdraw.rstore.pt -o jhotdraw.rviz

3. Visualize the resulting data:
	rviz jhotdraw.rviz
