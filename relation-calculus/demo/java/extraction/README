1. Extract facts from a given source package, e.g.

	 extract-java /home/paulk/software/source/sources/CH/ifa/draw

   This will take 3 minutes on a 1 Gig machine for 15 Kloc of souce code.

   This command creates a local directory called `extracted-rstores'.
   For each file F.java it creates a new file rstore/F.java.rstore.pt

   This is an rstore that contains the facts extracted from that file.
   The extension .pt indicates that the restore is in binary 
   parse tree format, recognized by the tools we use.

   If you want to inspect the contents of such a generated file do

	 unparsePT -i extracted-rstores/F.java.rstore.pt

   and this will give you the extracted data as text.

2. Merge the resulting rstores, e.g.

	 merge-rstores extracted-rstores/*.pt

   This will take another minute.

   The result is a combined Rstore called `result.rstore.pt'

   If you prefer, you can name the output file yourself
   (e.g. hotdraw.rstore.pt) and set the verbose option to see what is
   going on:
	 merge-rstores -v -o jhotdraw.rstore.pt extracted-rstores/*.pt

3. Convert the merged rstore to visualization data:
	rstore2rviz -i jhotdraw.rstore.pt -o jhotdraw.rviz


4. Visualize the resulting data:
	rviz jhotdraw.rviz
