\section{Introduction}

This series of exercises is intended to get some experience with
the analysis of the source code of software systems.

\section{Exercises}

\subsection{Some simple queries}
 Given are:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt bag[int] B1 = \{ 83, 53, 79, 1, 13, 17, 71, 19, 27, 33, 49, 67\}}.

\item {\tt rel[str,str] calls = \{
<"R", "A">,<"R", "B">,
<"A", "D">, <"B", "A">, <"B", "D">, <"B", "E">,
<"C", "F">, <"C", "G">, <"D", "L">, <"E", "H">,
<"F", "I">, <"G", "I">, <"G", "J">,<"H", "K">, <"H", "E">,
<"I", "K">,  <"K", "I">,<"L", "H">
\}}
\end{itemize}

Write an \rscript to answer each of the following questions:

\begin{itemize}

\item[Q1]
Compute {\tt rel[int,bag[int] R} such that each element in {\tt B1} is related to all
elements in {\tt B1} that are smaller than that element.

\item[Q2] What are the \emph{entry points} of {\tt calls}?
An entry point is a procedure that is itself not called by another procedure.

\item[Q3] What are the \emph{leaves} of {\tt calls}?
A leave is a procedure that does not makes calls to other procedures.

\item[Q4] What is the transitive closure of the {\tt calls} relation?

\item[Q5] Which procedures can be called
(indirectly) from each entry point?

\item[Q6] Which procedures are \emph{common}, i.e. are called from all entry points?

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Java Queries}

Given are the following relations about the AWT sources:

\begin{itemize}

\item {\tt rel[str,str] INHERITANCE}: If {\tt <C$_1$, C$_2$>} is an
element of {\tt INHERITANCE}, then class {\tt C$_1$} either extends
class {\tt C$_2$} or {\tt C$_1$} implements interface {\tt C$_2$}.

\item {\tt rel[str,str] CONTAINMENT}: If {\tt <C$_1$, C$_2$>} is an
element of {\tt CONTAINMENT}, then one of the attributes of class {\tt
C$_1$} is of type {\tt C$_2$}.

\item {\tt rel[area,str] METHOD\_DECL}: relates the text area of a method
declaration to the name of the declared method.

\item {\tt rel[area,str] CLASS\_DECL}: relates the text area of a class
declaration to the name of the declared class.

\end{itemize}

Write an \rscript to answer each of the following questions:

\begin{itemize}

\item[Q7] How many class declarations are there?

\item[Q8] What is the largest class?

\item[Q9] How many method declarations are there?

\item[Q10] What is the largests method?

\item[Q11] Which cases of degenerate inheritance are there?

\item[Q12] Find similar classes. Here we define similar as: (a) contain the
same classes; (b) inherit from the same classes.

\end{itemize}
