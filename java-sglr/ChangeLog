 * java-sglr.pc.in: started a package to contain a Java version
   of the SGLR parse table interpreter. This project was started
   with Cahal Boogerds Master Project. Now there is an alternative
   version written By Karl Trygve Kalleberg. For now, both versions
   will reside in this package, and be merged in one way or another.
   In any case, this package will be released after all regression tests
   with the C SGLR version succeed.
