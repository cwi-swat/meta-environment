 * **/GraphBuilder.java: removed author names per method, and fixed
   a serious bug. The rel[str,str] visualization was not up-to-date
   with the new graph interface.

Tue Apr 10 09:42:26 CEST 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * **/*.java: debugged generic bridge to dot, and debugged labels
   in shaped nodes. Now using the Decorator interface of prefuse.

 * **/*.java: added support for varying the width and the height of nodes 
  from an RStore, also you may select shapes (ellipse, circle, box).
  The type of the relation that is supported by this viz is:
   rel[<str,rel[str,str]>,str], where the first element is an attributed
   "from" node, and the second is the id of the "to node"

 * **/*.java: added a new bridge for dot. This works directly on the
   prefuse data model by wrapping the Graph class, and providing specialized
   Renderers for Nodes and Edges. The current form is taken mainly from
   the graph-gui package, but abstracts now from the graph data-structure
   completely. Extensions to be added are node shapes and colors, etc.
 * **/*.java: the treeLayout is replaced by dotlayout now.

 * *: added some try catch blocks to make the graph visualizer more robust
   against RTuples that have contents that does not correspond to the declared
   types.

 * *: initial import from Dancing Bear project
