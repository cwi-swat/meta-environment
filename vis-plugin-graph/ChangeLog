 * **/*.java: added a new bridge for dot. This works directly on the
   prefuse data model by wrapping the Graph class, and providing specialized
   Renderers for Nodes and Edges. The current form is taken mainly from
   the graph-gui package, but abstracts now from the graph data-structure
   completely. Extensions to be added are node shapes and colors, etc.
 * **/*.java: the treeLayout is replaced by dotlayout now.

 * *: added some try catch blocks to make the graph visualizer more robust
   against RTuples that have contents that does not correspond to the declared
   types.
