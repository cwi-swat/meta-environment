<H1>The ToolBus</H1>

<P>
The ToolBus is a software application architecture developed at
the University of Amsterdam by J.A. Bergstra and P. Klint\cite{BK95.toolbus}.
The ToolBus utilizes a scripting language based on process 
algebra\cite{BW90} to
describe the communication between software tools. A ToolBus \emph{script}
describes a number of processes that can communicate with each other and
with tools living outside the ToolBus.
A language-dependent adapter that translates between the internal
ToolBus data format and the data format used by the individual tools
makes it possible to write every tool in the language best suitable
for the task(s) it has to perform.

<P>
The following sections give an overview of the most important ToolBus
features. There is also a more complete overview of the ToolBus
primitives.

<HR>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><STRONG>Communication inside the ToolBus</STRONG></P>
There are two mechanisms available for processes in the ToolBus to
communicate with each other, message passing and selective broadcasting.
A process can synchronously send a <EM>message</EM> using the 
<CODE>snd-msg</CODE> 
primitive which must be received by another process using the
<CODE>rec-msg</CODE>
primitive. A process can send a <EM>note</EM> using 
<CODE>snd-note</CODE> to all processes that have subscribed, 
using <CODE>subscribe</CODE>,
to that particular note type. The receiving processes read notes 
asynchronously using <CODE>rec-note</CODE>, at low priority. 
Transmitting notes amounts to <EM>asynchronous selective broadcasting</EM>.

<HR>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><STRONG>Communication between ToolBus and tools</STRONG></P>
A ToolBus process can initiate communication with a tool by sending a 
message to a tool using <CODE>snd-do</CODE>, or <CODE>snd-eval</CODE>
 when an answer is expected. 
A tool can initiate communication by sending an <EM>event</EM>
to the ToolBus. A ToolBus process receives this event using
using the <CODE>rec-event</CODE> primitive and must acknowledge the event 
using the <CODE>snd-ack-event</CODE> primitive.

The execution and termination of the tools attached to the ToolBus, as well
as their connection/disconnection can be controlled explicitly by appropriate
primitives (See Section \ref{tb-primitives}).

<HR>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><STRONG>Process composition</STRONG></P>
More complex processes can be created using process composition operators
for <EM>choice</EM> (<CODE>+</CODE> operator), <EM>sequential composition</EM>
(<CODE>.</CODE> operator), 
<EM>parallel composition</EM> (<CODE>||</CODE>} operator),
<EM>iteration</EM> (<CODE>*</CODE> operator) and 
<EM>guarded (conditional) execution</EM>
(the <CODE>if/then/fi</CODE> operator). The <EM>process creation</EM>
primitive <CODE>create</CODE> can be used to create new processes.

<HR>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><STRONG>Types and variables</STRONG></P>
All terms within the ToolBus are <EM>typed</EM>. 
The ToolBus defines a number of
basic types for booleans, integers, reals, strings, and binary strings. Complex
types can be formed using a list constructor or function application. The type
term is a supertype of all other types. The <CODE>let/in/endlet</CODE> 
construction makes it possible to declare variables.

<HR>
<H2>A small example</H2>

To familiarize the reader with the syntax and semantics of ToolBus scripts,
this section contains a small example.
This example also familiarizes the reader with the use of noweb to
present code fragments. Noweb is a system for literate programming
as described in \cite{Knuth:CJ-27-2-97}, 
and is used to keep this document consistent
with the actual system.

In this example, a ToolBus script is presented that connects two tools, 
a calculator tool
that calculates expressions and a user interface tool that asks the
user for expressions and presents the result of calculating that expression.

This ToolBus script contains two processes, a <CODE>UI</CODE> process that
handles user interface events and a <CODE>CALC</CODE> process communicating 
with the calculator tool. 

<PRE>
process UI is
let
  UI : ui,
  E : str,
  V : str
in
  execute(ui, UI?) .
  ( rec-event(UI, expr(E?)) .
    snd-msg(calc, expr(E)) .
    rec-msg(calc, expr(E, V?)) .
    snd-ack-event(UI, expr(E, V))
  ) * 
  rec-event(UI, quit) .
  snd-ack-event(UI, quit) .
  shutdown("Goodbye!")
endlet


process CALC is
let
  Calc : calc,
  E : str,
  V : str
in
  execute(calc, Calc?) .
  ( rec-msg(calc, expr(E?)) .
    snd-eval(Calc, expr(E)) .
    rec-value(Calc, expr(E, V?)) .
    snd-msg(calc, expr(E, V))
  ) * delta
endlet
</PRE>

Tool declarations make it possible for the ToolBus to find and execute
tools. A tool declaration introduces a new type, that can later be
used to declare tool identifier variables of that type.
In our example script, two tools are defined:
<UL>
<LI>The <CODE>ui</CODE> tool, that implements the user interface.
<LI>The <CODE>calc</CODE> tool, that implements the calculator.
</UL>
<PRE>
tool ui is { command = "wish-adapter -script ui.tcl" }
tool calc is { command = "calc" }
</PRE>

Finally, the ToolBus configuration primitive 
<CODE>toolbus(UI,CALC)</CODE> starts the two processes in parallel.
<PRE>
toolbus(UI,CALC)
</PRE>
