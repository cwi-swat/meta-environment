The ToolBus is a software application architecture developed at
the University of Amsterdam by J.A. Bergstra and P. Klint.
The ToolBus utilizes a scripting language based on process
algebra to
describe the communication between software tools. A ToolBus <EM>script</EM>
describes a number of processes that can communicate with each other and
with tools living outside the ToolBus.
A language-dependent adapter that translates between the internal
ToolBus data format and the data format used by the individual tools
makes it possible to write every tool in the language best suited
for the task(s) it has to perform.
