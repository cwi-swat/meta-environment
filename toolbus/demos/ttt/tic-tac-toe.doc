One of the options of this assignment was to design a boardgame for two persons
using the ToolBus and Tcl/Tk at least. One of the obvious games to choose for
such an assignment was Tic Tac Toe. I don't describe the game here, because it
should be common knowledge ;).

Implementation was done using an array in Tcl/Tk to hold an X if the coordinate
was occupied by X, and similar for O. The implementation was quite straight
forward. No Makefile is needed because there are no files that need to be 
compiled. No real design problems, except for the normal debugging occured.

Possible extensions of this program could be: Tic Tac Toe in 3D, Tic Tac Toe
with size n instead of size 3, and a maybe implementation of 4 in a row. 

Start the game up by typing:

toolbus tic-tac-toe.tcl &

and activate users by typing the command:

t 

If you are playing from another station then where the toolbus is started use:

t -TB_HOST <toolbus-host>

Have fun !!!
