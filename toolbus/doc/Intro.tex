\begin{abstract}

The \TB\ is a new software architecture intended for building
cooperating, distributed applications.  This document aims
at providing an easy to use introduction to using and programming
the ToolBus.

\section{First steps}

By the time you are reading this document, you have probably already
found the ToolBus distribution, because this document is part of it.

The first thing to do, is locating the \TB\ executable. It is usually
called {\tt toolbus}, so you can try using the command {\tt which toolbus}
to see if the {\tt toolbus} executable is already in your
search path:

\begin{verbatim}
olivierp@gene 180> which toolbus
/home/gipe/petr/bin/toolbus
olivierp@gene 181>
\end{verbatim}

If this is not the case, your best bet might be to try the {\tt bin}
directory of the \TB\ distribution from which you got this document.
Or you might try to use the {\tt locate} command
to find its location:
\begin{verbatim}
olivierp@gene 185> locate toolbus | grep bin
/nfs/gene/gen3/gipe/petr/bin/toolbus
\end{verbatim}

When you have found the {\tt toolbus} executable, and it is not yet
in your search path, you might want to add it. If you do not know how
to do this, please consult somebody with a basic understanding of the
unix shell, like your system administrator.

Now please start the \TB\ with the {\tt -v} option, to test your setup,
and to see which version of the \TB\ you are using:

\begin{verbatim}
olivierp@gene 186> toolbus -version
version: ToolBus-0.9.19
olivierp@gene 187>
\end{verbatim}

You are all set, and ready to go!

\section{The {\tt calc} demo}

We will show some of the \TB\ features using the simple {\tt calc} demo.
First, {\tt cd} to the directory {\tt demos/calc} in the \TB\ distribution.
Now start the calculator demo by issuing the following command:

\begin{verbatim}
toolbus calc.tb
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centerline{\psfig{file=calc-ui.eps}}
\caption{The calculator user interface}
\label{calc-ui}
\end{figure}

The calculator user interface comes up as shown in Figure \ref{calc-ui}.
Pressing the {\tt Calc} button pops up a new window to ask you to enter
an expression like {\tt plus(3,times(2,5))}.
When you are done entering this expression, just press 
\verb@<Return>@, and the result will pop up in another window.

Pressing the {\tt showLog} button will popup a window showing the
expressions calculated so far, including expressions calculated
by a hidden {\tt batch} tool.


The {\tt showTime} button can be used to display the current time.
You can use the {\tt Quit} button to end the demo.

\subsection{The calculator \TB\ configuration}

Figure \ref{calc-impl} shows the calculator demo \TB\ configuration.
The calculator demo consists of four tools:

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centerline{\psfig{file=calc.ps}}
\caption{The calculator \TB\ configuration}
\label{calc-impl}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item The {\tt clock} tool delivers the current time on request.
\item The {\tt ui} tool implements the user interface of the calulator demo.
\item The {\tt calc} tool calculates the values of expressions.
\item The {\tt batch} tool generates expressions at random time intervals.
\end{itemize}

The communication between these four tools os controlled by five processes:
\begin{itemize}
\item The {\tt CLOCK} process catches requests for the current time,
      relays them to the {\tt clock} tool, and sends the answer back.
\item The {\tt UI} process waits for user actions, and translates
      them into requests to the {\tt CLOCK}, {\tt CALC}, or {\tt LOG}
      process.
\item The {\tt CALC} process waits for expression calculation requests,
      calculates the value of the expression, and sends the result back.
      This process also broadcasts the expression/result pairs.
\item The {\tt LOG} process waits on broadcasted expression/result pairs,
      and logs them in a list.
      On request, the {\tt LOG} process can send this complete log of
      evaluated expressions.
\item The {\tt BATCH} process waits for evaluation requests from the
      batch tool, and relays them to the {\tt CALC} process.
\end{itemize}

\section{The auction demo}

Now we come to the {\tt auction} demo. {\tt cd} to the directory
{\tt demos/auction} in the \TB\ distribution. Now start the calculator
demo by issuing the following command:

\begin{verbatim}
toolbus auction.tb
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centerline{\psfig{file=auction-master.eps}}
\caption{The auction master}
\label{auction-master}
\end{figure}

This will start the auction master, shown in Figure \ref{auction-master}. 
You can start different bidders (Figure \ref{auction-bidder})
like this:

\begin{verbatim}
bidder -name Pieter
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centerline{\psfig{file=auction-bidder.eps}}
\caption{A bidder}
\label{auction-bidder}
\end{figure}

The auction begins when the auction master presses the {\tt New}
button after entering an item for sale and the starting `highest
bid'. The bidders can now freely bid, until nobody has makes a new
bid for ten seconds. At everybody is notified that the bidding is
about to end. If nobody reopens the bidding in another ten seconds,
the item is sold to the highest bidder.

\subsection{The auction \TB\ configuration}


Figure \ref{auction-impl} shows the auction demo \TB\ configuration.
The consists of demo consists of two different tools:

\begin{itemize}
\item The {\tt master} tool represents the auction master. Only one
 of these can be present at any one time.
\item The {\tt bidder} tool implements the bidder user interface.
      Any number of bidders can be present. Bidders can enter and leave
      the auction when they want.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centerline{\psfig{file=auction.ps}}
\caption{The auction demo \TB\ configuration}
\label{auction-impl}
\end{figure}


The communication between these four tools os controlled by two processes:
\begin{itemize}
\item The {\tt Auction} process regulates the auction demo. 
      It connects new bidders,
      and controls the auction of items.
\item The{\tt Bidder} processes control individual bidders.
      For every new bidder, the {\tt Auction} process creates a new
      {\tt Bidder} process to control this new bidder.
\end{itemize}
