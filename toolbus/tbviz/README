tbviz -- Visualization for the ToolBus

author: Tobias Kuipers, <tobias@acm.org>, 1997--1999

To get started, install the ToolBus as described in the toplevel
ToolBus directory. You'll need to have an executable called
perl5.00404 (Don't blame me for this name :-) in your PATH. tbviz
needs the LWP/UserAgent and URI/URL perl modules (and a fairly recent 
version at that), so make sure you have these.

An executable called
  tbgraph
will be installed in your bin directory. 

To visualize a T-script file.tb type
  tbgraph o file.tb

where o is one of 
  -g for Gif output
  -ps for PostScript output
  -d for dot output

The resulting graph will be written to standard out.

type tbgraph -h for help

Note that tbgraph is only the client side of the ToolBus
visualization. The server is contacted automatically by the client, so 
you can only do this if you have a Net connection.

See <http://www.cwi.nl/~kuipers/tbviz/tbviz.html> for more details.

Please let me know if you have any complaints/bugs/praise

Have fun,

Tobias
