tbviz -- Visualization for the ToolBus

author: Tobias Kuipers, <kuipers@cwi.nl>, 1997

To get started, install the ToolBus as described in the toplevel
ToolBus directory.

This will install (among other things) an executable called
  tbgraph
in your bin directory. 

To create a graph from a ToolBus script file.tb, type
  tbgraph file.tb
This will create the files file.tb.dot and file.tb.ps. The .dot file is a
dot representation of the graph. It can be viewed using doted. The .ps file
is a PostScript picture of the same graph. If the graph is too large to fit
on a single page, the PostScript file consists of more pages, which can be 
arranged together to form the full graph.

The graph that is created displays each process in the ToolBus script
as a single node. The edges in the graph represent a *possible*
communication between two processes. To be more precise: A snd-msg
term from a process matches a rec-msg term from a (not necessarily
another) process. Not even may such a communication never occur, it can
even be impossible for such a communication to occur. (For instance is
the snd and rcv are by the same process). 

Currently, only messages are considered. Notes, and communications
between processes and tools are not considered (yet).

In order to use tbgraph, you need to have an executable called "dot"
in your PATH. If you can't find it, ask around. If you still can't
find it, it is part of the AT&T graphviz package:
<http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/>

The generation of the PostScript file is currently not
parameterized. If you want another (font|color|size|shape), use the
.dot file to create a new PostScript file. The .dot file does not
contain any information on the above (font|color|size|shape). You can
look in the tbgraph script to see which parameters I use.

Finally, you'll need to have perl in your PATH.

Please let me know if you have any complaints/bugs/praise

Have fun,

Tobias
