<H1>TIDE: A Multi-Language, Multi-Platform, distributed debugger.</H1>

<P>
By providing an abstraction layer on top of the native debugging interface
of different language environments, TIDE is able to provide a 
consistent user interface when debugging a distributed system that
runs on different platforms and is implemented using different source
languages.

<P>
When a component announces to TIDE that it provides a debugging interface,
it must declare which debugging capabilities it has to offer. These
capabilities are closely related to a
<A HREF="taxonomy.html">taxonomy of debugging features</A> based on
the debugging features found in most modern language environments.
