Wed Mar  8 17:32:28 CET 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * toolbus/tools.c: changed the tool protocol. A tool may send
   a disconnect even when in waiting on a result from the
   snd-eval or snd-do.

Wed Feb 22 11:11:35 CET 2006 <{jurgenv,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * libtb/utils.c: added underscore as one of the characters acceptible
   in a function application term and a variable term.
 * libtb/utils.c:
   - Add parameter to parse_term0() so you can make the choice to parse input 
     as variable. Only parse a variable when parsing ToolBus scripts. When
     sending terms using sockets we don't parse variables.
   - Changed calls to parse_term0() so they use the new choice.

Wed Jan  4 15:21:01 CET 2006 <{jurgenv,kooiker,paulk}@cwi.nl>
 * toolbus/interpreter.c: fixed a bug in expansion of dynamic calls,
   the result variables of a dyncall were not propagated to the
   rest of the execution of a process.

Fri Dec 16 13:03:52 CET 2005 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * test/Makefile.am:
   - added bug-481.tb{,.out} to extra dist

Thu Dec 15 16:32:54 CET 2005 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * adapters/toolbus-adapter/toolbus-adapter.tbi: wrapped Msg by
   toolbus-msg(Msg) in the script, because of new requirement.

Thu Dec 15 15:49:54 CET 2005 <{kooiker,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
 * toolbus/{typecheck.c,script.y}: Extended typechecker to not accept
   snd-msg or rec-msg with a first argument that is not a function
   application. This is necessary for the communication partner cache
   to work properly. This closes Bug #481.
 * test/Makefile.am: flipped test case for bug 481 to a fail test.

Tue Dec 13 13:03:48 CET 2005 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * test/bug-481.tb: testcase exercising Bug #481

Thu Oct 20 15:15:24 CEST 2005 <{gerco,jong}@cwi.nl>
 * configure.in:
   - add --enable-maintainer-mode
	 - remove --with-cflags
	 - fix CFLAGS used during ./configure run

Tue Aug 16 11:41:48 CEST 2005 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * configure.in: check for availability of mkdtemp()
 * toolbus/Makefile.am, toolbus/mkdtemp.c:
   - added mkdtemp implementation for platforms without native mkdtemp

Mon Aug 15 14:50:34 CEST 2005 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * libtb/sockets.{c,h}: change int to socklen_t in accept_in_interval
 * libtb/symbol.h: 
   - removed unnecessary extern declaration of hash_table and idx_table

Mon Aug 15 14:53:14 CEST 2005 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * configure.in: add AC_PROG_LIBTOOL to cope with dynamic ATerm library

Fri May 27 09:23:00 CEST 2005 <{jurgenv,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * toolbus/calls.c: Fixed declaration after statement error.

Tue May 24 09:14:40 CEST 2005 <{jurgenv,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * toolbus/partners.c: Added memset after realloc to ensure all new 
   cells are set to zero in the implementations of the communication 
   partner cache.
	
Sun May 22 22:16:36 CEST 2005 <paulk@cwi.nl>
* Checked all numbers produced by logger. The to/from data for
  communication with tools is now correct.
* Reimplemented the UI of the logger. All statistics are now shown in 
  a text pane and there are two buttons:
  Show Statistics: prints all statistcs about processes and tools
  Clear Data:      sets all counters to zero (this allows detailed
                   profiling of specific scenarios)

Fri May 20 02:42:56 CEST 2005 <paulk@cwi.nl>
* Extended logger.tcl with tool statistics.
  Warning: do not yet believe any of these numbers :-)

Fri May 20 01:59:49 CEST 2005 <paulk@cwi.nl>
 * Extended logger.tcl: at the end of execution of the ToolBus application
   a summary of execution statistics for processes is printed.
	
Thu May 19 23:37:57 CEST 2005 <paulk@cwi.nl>
 * Fixed bug in dynamic calls: only local variables of type string
   lead to dynamic calls (as promised).
	
Thu May 19 09:47:08 CEST 2005 <{jurgenv,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * Merged find_comm_optimization into trunk

Wed May 18 18:23:52 CEST 2005 <{jurgenv,jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * Optimization experiment: find_comm uses a statically created
   cache of which processes might communicate with each other.
   A significant speedup is expected.

Sat May 14 22:46:34 CEST 2005 Paul Klint <paulk@cwi.nl>
 * Extended expansion of process calls P(A1, A2, ...) inside process definitions:
   - Old situation: P was required to be a process defined somewhere
     in the script.
   _ New situation: P may also be a string variable defined in the current
     process (as formal parameter or let-variable). The string value of P
     is taken as the process name.
   - The above implies run-time typechecking (only for these "dynamic calls").
   - Example:
       process A(S : str) is printf("%s A\n", S)
       process B(S : str) is printf("%s B\n", S)
       process Main is
       let P: str
       in
          P := "B" .
          P("MESSAGE")
       endlet

       toolbus(Main)
	
     will print: "MESSAGE B"
   - Possible errors:
	. The string value is not a name that occurs in some process
	  definition.
	. The actual/formal parameters do not match.
   - Caveat: if P occurs as a variable of a type other than string, the
     old interpretation applies.

 * Extended the command line options to allow multiple Tscript source files.

Fri Apr 29 13:45:43 CEST 2005 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * toolbus/script.l:
   - increase size of string buffer from 512 to BUFSIZ

Mon Apr 11 13:25:33 CEST 2005 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * toolbus/script.y:
   - Removed the chdir(2) part in the temporary file name issue (see below).
     Since we use absolute pathnames anyway, we don't have to "chdir" (which
     broke things like "-I .")
   - Use the tail of the incoming filename, as it is sometimes "../../file.c",
     which makes for nasty pathnames: /var/tmp/TBxkdhf/../../file.c"

Mon Apr 11 09:20:13 CEST 2005 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * package:
   - Bumped version to 1.3.1
 * toolbus/script.y:
   - Removed TBtmpname which constructed a filename based on getpid(2) which
     was not enough to ensure uniqueness of the temporary file;
   - We cannot use mkstemp(3) instead, because it dictates that the filename
     end in 'XXXXXX' which conflicts with the preprocessor which demands that
     the filenames end in ".c" and ".i", respectively;
   - Therefore, use mkdtemp(3) to create a unique temporary directory in which
     to store the temporary files;
   - We now depend on getcwd(3), chdir(2), mkdtemp(3), unlink(2), and rmdir(2).

Tue Jul 13 14:06:30 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Moved toolbus java adapter to its own separate package
 * Bumped version to 1.3

Thu Jun 10 15:06:28 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Merged changed in java toolbus adapter (locking functionality)

Wed Apr 21 10:45:32 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Removed #include <sys/sockets.h> from toolbus/main.c because it somehow
   breaks the build on the newest Darwin release (7.3.0). This include was
   not needed apparently, because the code still compiles on Linux.

Fri Mar 19 08:24:48 CET 2004 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * toolbus/{main.c,script.l}:
   - add missing (int) casts to isspace functions

Wed Apr  7 16:11:00 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Prints only the stopped processed with CTRL+\

Thu Mar 11 18:37:51 CET 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * -ltb library from the toolbuslib package is deprecated and was only used 
   inside of the toolbus package. So I moved it into the toolbus package
   as a library that is NOT installed only used here.

Fri Feb 27 11:54:54 CET 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * toolbus/script.y: increase CMD_MAX tenfold to 10240 to accomodate
   long '-I' paths

Tue Feb 10 15:24:54 CET 2004 <m336@cwi.nl>
 * upgrade auto* to: autoconf 2.59, automake 1.7.9, libtool 1.5.2
 * version bump to 1.1

Tue Feb 10 10:53:28 CET 2004 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * adapters/toolbus-adapter/toolbus-adapter.c,
   demos/calc/log.c, batch.c, calc.c: 
   - added const to char* arguments

Mon Feb  9 14:48:28 CET 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Generating 'const char*' instead of 'char*' pointers to be able
   to find errors quicker in ToolBus components.

Mon Feb  2 16:34:09 CET 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * upgraded several Makefile.am files to get 'distcheck' working

2003/11/07 <{jong,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
 * Set version of toolbus to 1.0. Notice that versions 0.3 and 0.3.1 
   are strange because the version before 0.3 was 0.25 (a later version).

Tue Oct 14 09:51:09 CEST 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * toolbus/tools.c:
   - only warn about lost connections if TBverbose is set. Closes #75.


2003/09/30 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * toolbus/viewer.tcl.src:
   - walk over existing array elements. Closes #4.

Thu Sep 11 11:39:49 CEST 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * adapters/gen-adapter:
   - add generic-adapter.idef, crafted from meta's "gen.tb"

2003/08/01 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Bumped to version 0.3.1
 * Set dependency on aterm-java-1.3.2

2003/07/02 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Bumped to version 0.3 and release

2003/06/26 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
Tue Jul  1 14:38:00 CEST 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * aterm:
   - added first version of 'merge-tifs' which merges two tifs files.
     This version is *not* robust against commandline mistakes.

Mon Jun 30 10:03:16 CEST 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * add "--with-trans-adapter" to enable transparent TB-adapter
 * adapters/trans:
   - fix Taeke's renaming of java files in Makefile.am

2003-06-27 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * adapters/java-adapter/AbstractTool.java:
   - fixed missing initialization of port (now set to -1)
 * toolbus/trans:
   - Added first version of transparent toolbus-to-toolbus adapter
   - Both sides of the adapter are generic now
   - Added startup parameters:
     -TB_MASKERADE_HOST, -TB_DELEGATE_HOST,
     -TB_MASKERADE_PORT, -TB_DELEGATE_PORT,
     -TB_MASKERADE_TOOL, -TB_DELEGATE_TOOL
   - Refactoring: connection1 has become the maskerade side
                  connection2 has become the delegate side
 
2003-06-26 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Added package definition file

2003-06-17 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
  * Added an error message for when no 'toolbus' command at all are contained
    in the script. 
  * Added \r to layout to prevent strange parse errors when parsing a script
    that was written in Windows.

2003-06-17 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * toolbus/viewer.tcl.src:
   - Fixed variable viewer displaying quotes and own processname

2003-06-17 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * toolbus/viewer.tcl.src: added slider to be able to shorten the delay
   time dynamically

2003-06-13 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * fix toolbus/viewer.tcl.src: for some reason double click to show the
   process variables didn't work anymore

2003-06-13 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * toolbus/viewer.tcl.src:
   - Tool and process breakpoints do work now
   - Right click (re-)sets breakpoint at line or on process/tool
   - After extending the toolbus view with a new line of processes, tool 
     breakpoints stay visible
   - After changing scriptview, breakpoints are colored again
   - Reaching a linebreak causes the scriptview to switch to the breaking 
     script
   - By resizing the viewer window, hidden tools will be displayed 

2003-06-11 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * fix toolbus/viewer.tcl.src: bug introduced in previous version prevented 
   resetting of breakpoints 

2003-06-11 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * fix viewer.tcl.src: lsearch only checked if breakpoint was first in the
   list

2003-06-10 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * Debugger stops running at breakpoints.
 * Breakpoints possible in more than one toolbus script (now recording
   process and linenumber, was linenumber only)

2003-03-30 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Multiple toolbus(...) declarations allowed from now on

Tue May 13 14:02:52 CEST 2003 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * fix toolbus/idef2tif.src: handle "command = EDITOR" kind of #defines

2003-03-30 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Used backquotes to delay calling *-config scripts to after
   configure phase. Otherwise autobundle can't configure all packages
   before building them.

2003-03-28 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Moved dot-adapter (actually the dot tool) to graph-support package
 * removed dependency on graphviz

2003-03-20 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * removed dependency on shared-objects and jjtraveler. This is taken care
   of by aterm-java-config from now on.

2003-03-18 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Use shared-objects-config and aterm-java-config to obtain last versions
   of their jar files in configure.in

Mon Mar 17 10:11:35 CET 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * Major hack to fix unexpected dependency on jjtraveler:
   expect it in the same location as aterm-java.jar and use
   it to build tifstojava.
 * and another: aterm-java distribution was changed to 1.2beta, so
   now toolbus (in a clean build-environment) cannot find
   aterm-java-1.1.jar anymore.

Wed Feb 26 09:38:06 CET 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * fix perl-adapter: use mkstemp instead of unsafe tmpnam.
   Closes some security-conscious user reports.

Tue Feb 25 12:42:59 CET 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * fix java-adapter: do not generate import statements for unused imports.

Thu Feb 13 11:39:43 CET 2003 <{jong,olivierp}@cwi.nl>
 * version 0.26beta
 * java-adapter/SwingTool.java: downgraded to work with JDK1.3
 * fix parsing of dot-files: accept \
   in attribute values
 * HACK: fix PATH in adapters/dot-adapter to get idef2tif working

2003-02-12 <olivierp@cwi.nl>
 * Added the '-m' option to the shell: SIGQUIT is now passed on to the
   child processes, so a thread dump can be forced by sending this signal
   to the Java child!
 * Introduced the notion of 'swing' tools: if you supply the '-swing'
   option to tifstojava SwingTool will be subclassed instead of AbstractTool.
   This causes all toolbus callbacks to be called from within the Swing
   event thread instead of the ToolBus thread.

2003-01-23 <{jong,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
 * Recover missing ChangeLog entries
 * Compatibalize --with-java option in all meta-pkgs

2003-01-22 <{jong,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
  * Release 0.25

2002-11-25  Hayco de Jong  <jong@cwi.nl>
  * ChangeLog:
    - adopted new ChangeLog style which seems to be in use :-)
  * toolbus/script.y:
    - fix: new version of bison found 7 missing ';' separators
  * adapters/java-adapter/toolbus/tifstojava.in:
    - add: shared_objects' location via @SHARED_OBJECTS@
    - fix: aterm-java classes are in @ATERM_JAVA@, no longer in @ATERM@

2002/10/30 (vinju@cwi.nl)
 * Added new dependency on aterm-java package

 * Fixed CLASSPATH in tifstojava to locate aterm classes correctly.

2002/03/27 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Made toolbus take CPPFLAGS into account when calling the C preprocessor.
   This should partly fix some portability issue for MacOS X.
 * Added substitution of CPP and CPPFLAGS to configure.in.

2002/03/05 (jong@cwi.nl)
 * Several adapters 'omgeSPECt' from 8 to 12 bytes

2002/02/14 (olivierp@cwi.nl)
 * Bumped to 0.23beta
 * Added dot-adapter

2002/02/07 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)

2001/08/21 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
 * Fixed search for header files in configure.in

2001/08/21 (jong@cwi.nl)

- Further work done eliminating subtle bugs related to variable management. The
  prototypical  case to worry about is:
	let X : int in ... endlet || let X : int in ... endlet
  Major step: environments are from now on attached to *atoms* as opposed to
  a whole process (as was done until now).
- ``Make dist'' now generates the tar.gz in .. rather than in .
- The gen-adapter was not made, adjusted (the doc still has to be fixed).
- Test procedures now compare their output with previous output (reduces the
  amount of output of testing).
- Compiled with ``-pedantic -Wall'' and removed some minor stilistic errors
  in various files.

- Changed directory structure under adapters. Now every adapter has its
  own subdirectory.
- Added configure options:
  --with-tcl/--without-tcl (default: yes) is tcl/tk present?
  --with-perl/--without-perl (default: yes) is perl present?
  --with-swipl/--without-swipl (default: no) is swi-prolog present?
  Both the adapter building and demo building now depends on these options.
- Cleaned up --with-gel option
- Added python and swi-prolog adapters.
- Added the following demos:
  - battleships (written by Hayco de Jong)
  - go-moku (written by Jan Kort)
  - ttt (tic-tac-toe, written by Timme Dekker)
  - swipl-ttt (written by Monajemi Ramin) 
- Added CHANGES.log file.

- I have appended here the old CHANGES file that I maintained privately.

December, 1994

- Incorporated Simon Gray's bstring changes
- Renaming of some common parameters of adapters
- Improvements on asf+sdf-adapter, spec demo is now working
- Added a TB_LOCAL_PORTS flag (for systems with dial-up slip
  connections, like mine since a week)
- Updated documentation

November, 1994

- Major reorganisation of the distribution and complete
  switch to Autoconf 2.0, for configuration management.

October 12, 1994

- Added a TB_TRACING option to toolbus with values:
  . none	no tracing
  . internal	print textual trace on stdout
  . external	execute an external trace tool

October 5, 1994

- wish-adapter now tests existence of tb.tcl and of argument script
  before calling wish

September 19, 1994

- Added a "test" directory
- Added a test program for match/TBmakeTerm and fixed several minor
  bugs in TBmatch.

September 14, 1994:

- CONFIG replaced by a configuration file generated by autoconf;
  consequently all Makefiles replaced by Makefile.in templates.

September 11, 1994:

- Added a destroy_ports functions in toolbus.c that unlinks
  all unix domain sockets in use.

September 5, 1994:

- Added a "details" field to tool definitions which is passed as
  string value of the switch -details of adapters.
- Rearranged standard arguments of adapters.
- Added an asf+sdf-adapter that directly reads/writes binary
  gel (for interfacing with compiled Asf+Sdf specifications only)

April 20, 1994:

- Several off-by-one errors (e.g. ntools, nproc, ncall, ...)
  in the interpreter have been fixed (thanks to Casper Dik)
- The "host" directive in tool definitions is now implemented.
  [Note: take care that the executable of the tool appears
   in the search path at the remote host]
- CONFIG and all Makefiles further reorganized;
  . CONFIG now takes a parameter naming a specific host
  . Support for Solaris included
  . Several Make variables have been added, in particular the
    way the C compiler is called from makefiles is changed.

April 19, 1994:

- The "spec" demo now also includes pretty printing
  (albeit not yet perfect)

April 6, 1994:

- Major progress with "spec" demo aiming at the construction of
  a term editor for the Booleans a la the ASF+SDF Meta-environment
- As a side effect several adapters have been written:
  . parser-adapter -- a general parser interface
  . gen-adapter    -- a generic adapter for Unix commands

April 1, 1994:

- bc-adapter written which allows the use of the Unix "bc" command
  in the calc demo

March 30, 1994:

- Complete reorganization of the directory structure into directories
	src		(the ToolBus interpreter)
	demos		(all demo's)
	adapters	(a collection of standard adapters, see below)
- A CONFIG program is introduced for better parameterization of the
  source code.
- All "ui.c" style programs in the demo's have been eliminated in favour
  of the use of one generic "wish-adapter". All tcl script are updated and
  now do the recognition of TB terms themselves.
- The processing of the "command" in a tool definition is improved,
  it is now possible to give arguments to Unix commands.

March 27, 1994:

- Fixed bug that prevents execution on multiple machines
- Added the flags (to ToolBus and tools)
	. TB_INPORT
	. TB_OUTPORT
 for explicitly defining the input/output socket to be used for the
 communication between ToolBus and tools (only relevant when more than
 one ToolBus interpreter is executting on the network).

March 24, 1994:

- Added: character input ports:
  . removed TBaddInPort
  . added TBaddTermPort (identical to the old TBaddInPort)
  . added TBaddCharPort:
	int TBaddCharPort(int, TBcallbackChar);
    where TBcallbackChar is defined by:
    	typedef term *(*TBcallbackChar)(int);
    
    Notes: - the int argument is the file descriptor on which
             character input is available.
	   - CONTRARY TO TERM PORTS THIS INPUT MUST BE READ BY THE HANDLER.
	   - the handler may return a term to be send to the ToolBus.

March 22, 1994:

- Reorganized the demo's and added a CONFIG file that contains
  site specific information (like, e.g., the path name of the
  wish interpreter used in the demo's)
- Completed the Constraints demo (demo-cons).


March 20, 1994:

- TBVERBOSE renamed to TB_VERBOSE
- TBDELAY renamed to TB_DELAY
- added TB_SINGLE flag for stand-alone execution of ToolBus
  or tool (as suggested by Calin Groza), e.g.
	calc -TB_SINGLE
  will ask for term input from standard input.
