Version:	0.9.16
Author:		Paul

- Further work done eliminating subtle bugs related to variable management. The
  prototypical  case to worry about is:
	let X : int in ... endlet || let X : int in ... endlet
  Major step: environments are from now on attached to *atoms* as opposed to
  a whole process (as was done until now).
- ``Make dist'' now generates the tar.gz in .. rather than in .
- The gen-adapter was not made, adjusted (the doc still has to be fixed).
- Test procedures now compare their output with previous output (reduces the
  amount of output of testing).
- Compiled with ``-pedantic -Wall'' and removed some minor stilistic errors
  in various files.

  Both the adapter building and demo building now depends on these options.

- I have appended here the old CHANGES file that I maintained privately.

December, 1994

- Incorporated Simon Gray's bstring changes
- Renaming of some common parameters of adapters
- Improvements on asf+sdf-adapter, spec demo is now working
- Added a TB_LOCAL_PORTS flag (for systems with dial-up slip
  connections, like mine since a week)
- Updated documentation

November, 1994

- Major reorganisation of the distribution and complete
  switch to Autoconf 2.0, for configuration management.

October 12, 1994

- Added a TB_TRACING option to toolbus with values:
  . none	no tracing
  . internal	print textual trace on stdout
  . external	execute an external trace tool

October 5, 1994

- wish-adapter now tests existence of tb.tcl and of argument script
  before calling wish

September 19, 1994

- Added a "test" directory
- Added a test program for match/TBmakeTerm and fixed several minor
  bugs in TBmatch.

September 14, 1994:

- CONFIG replaced by a configuration file generated by autoconf;
  consequently all Makefiles replaced by Makefile.in templates.

September 11, 1994:

- Added a destroy_ports functions in toolbus.c that unlinks
  all unix domain sockets in use.

September 5, 1994:

- Added a "details" field to tool definitions which is passed as
  string value of the switch -details of adapters.
- Rearranged standard arguments of adapters.
- Added an asf+sdf-adapter that directly reads/writes binary
  gel (for interfacing with compiled Asf+Sdf specifications only)

April 20, 1994:

- Several off-by-one errors (e.g. ntools, nproc, ncall, ...)
  in the interpreter have been fixed (thanks to Casper Dik)
- The "host" directive in tool definitions is now implemented.
  [Note: take care that the executable of the tool appears
   in the search path at the remote host]
- CONFIG and all Makefiles further reorganized;
  . CONFIG now takes a parameter naming a specific host
  . Support for Solaris included
  . Several Make variables have been added, in particular the
    way the C compiler is called from makefiles is changed.

April 19, 1994:

- The "spec" demo now also includes pretty printing
  (albeit not yet perfect)

April 6, 1994:

- Major progress with "spec" demo aiming at the construction of
  a term editor for the Booleans a la the ASF+SDF Meta-environment
- As a side effect several adapters have been written:
  . parser-adapter -- a general parser interface
  . gen-adapter    -- a generic adapter for Unix commands

April 1, 1994:

- bc-adapter written which allows the use of the Unix "bc" command
  in the calc demo

March 30, 1994:

- Complete reorganization of the directory structure into directories
	src		(the ToolBus interpreter)
	demos		(all demo's)
	adapters	(a collection of standard adapters, see below)
- A CONFIG program is introduced for better parameterization of the
  source code.
- All "ui.c" style programs in the demo's have been eliminated in favour
  of the use of one generic "wish-adapter". All tcl script are updated and
  now do the recognition of TB terms themselves.
- The processing of the "command" in a tool definition is improved,
  it is now possible to give arguments to Unix commands.

March 27, 1994:

- Fixed bug that prevents execution on multiple machines
- Added the flags (to ToolBus and tools)
	. TB_INPORT
	. TB_OUTPORT
 for explicitly defining the input/output socket to be used for the
 communication between ToolBus and tools (only relevant when more than
 one ToolBus interpreter is executting on the network).

March 24, 1994:

- Added: character input ports:
  . removed TBaddInPort
  . added TBaddTermPort (identical to the old TBaddInPort)
  . added TBaddCharPort:
	int TBaddCharPort(int, TBcallbackChar);
    where TBcallbackChar is defined by:
    	typedef term *(*TBcallbackChar)(int);
    
    Notes: - the int argument is the file descriptor on which
             character input is available.
	   - CONTRARY TO TERM PORTS THIS INPUT MUST BE READ BY THE HANDLER.
	   - the handler may return a term to be send to the ToolBus.

March 22, 1994:

- Reorganized the demo's and added a CONFIG file that contains
  site specific information (like, e.g., the path name of the
  wish interpreter used in the demo's)
- Completed the Constraints demo (demo-cons).


March 20, 1994:

- TBVERBOSE renamed to TB_VERBOSE
- TBDELAY renamed to TB_DELAY
- added TB_SINGLE flag for stand-alone execution of ToolBus
  or tool (as suggested by Calin Groza), e.g.
	calc -TB_SINGLE
  will ask for term input from standard input.
