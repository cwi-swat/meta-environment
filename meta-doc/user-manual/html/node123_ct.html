Rewriting a Term using a Compiled Specification
</H2>

<P>
In Compiling Specifications[Section&nbsp;]SEC:compilingaspecification
we explained how a given module <TT>M</TT>
can be compiled into C code. Here we describe how to compile and
use this generated C code. The steps are as follows:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Go to the directory where the Asf+Sdf2C compiler has generated
the C code.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Check whether there is a <TT>Makefile</TT>. If this is not the case
or you expect it to be invalid, generate a new one as follows:
<PRE>
   genmakefile -m M &gt; Makefile
</PRE>
where <TT>M</TT> is the name of the top module for which the C code was
generated.  There should also exist a file <TT>ModuleName.module-list</TT> in the directory with generated C code.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Use <TT>make</TT> to compile the generated C code.
The result is both a library <TT>libM.a</TT>
and an executable <TT>M</TT>. This library can be used 
when several compiled specifications have to be combined into a single executable
or when compiled specifications have to be combined with hand-written C code.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><P>
After 
parsing the term[ (as explained in
Section&nbsp;)]SEC:parsingofterms
that has to be reduced, this term can
be reduced via the compiled code as follows:

<P>
<PRE>
COMPILER_OUTPUT/ModuleName &lt; term.tree &gt; reduct.tree
</PRE>

<P>
Unparsing[Section&nbsp;]SEC:unparsing 
explains how <TT>reduct.tree</TT> can be
converted to a textual representation.
</LI>
</UL>
