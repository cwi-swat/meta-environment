Type check warnings for plain SDF
</H2>
The warnings and error for SDF are separated into 4 sections. First we will
discuss the type check warnings and errors[ (see
Section&nbsp;)]SEC:plainSDFerrors for plain SDF. This variant of SDF is
independent of ASF. Later we will discuss the warnings[ (see
Section&nbsp;)]SEC:ASFSDFwarnings and errors[ (see
Section&nbsp;)]SEC:ASFSDFerrors for SDF used in combination with ASF.
In this case we need to be more strict and every SDF construct is supported
by ASF.

<P>
Warnings do not break the specification, but it is advisable to fix
them anyway. Often they point out some not well-formed part in the
specification.

<P>

<UL>
<LI><TT>undeclared sorts</TT> This warning indicates that a sort is used
which is not explicitly declared, or it is declared but in a hidden
section.
</LI>
<LI><TT>double declared sort</TT> This warning points out that the sort is
already declared somewhere in this module, or in one of the imported
modules.
</LI>
<LI><TT>double declared start-symbol</TT>
This warning indicates that
the start-symbol is previously defined as start-symbol as well. This can
be in the current module or in one of the imported modules.
</LI>
<LI><TT>illegal attribute: {bracket, left, right, assoc, non-assoc}</TT>
This warning is generated because the syntactic form the production rule
and the attribute do not match. Given this mismatch the intended behaviour
will not be effective.
</LI>
<LI><TT>used in priorities but undefined</TT>
This warning is generated whenever a production rule is used in a priority
section which is not defined in this module or in one of the imported
modules. It is possible that this production rule will be defined in
one of the modules which imports this module. Normally, this indicates
some typo.
</LI>
<LI><TT>inconsistent rhs in priorities</TT>
This warning is caused by a production rule which has not the same
right-hand side as the other production rules in the priority relation.
Whenever this occurs the effect of the expressed priority relation will
be ignored.  This check is performed modulo injections.
</LI>
<LI><TT>unknown constructor used in priorities</TT>
This warning indicates the use of a constructor which is not used in
the corresponding set of production rules with the same right-hand side.
This is a very weak check on consistent use of constructor information.
</LI>
<LI><TT>sort CHAR used in production rule</TT>
</LI>
<LI><TT>deprecated tuple notation</TT>
</LI>
<LI><TT>deprecated unquoted symbol notation</TT>
</LI>
<LI><TT>deprecated non-plain sort definition</TT>
</LI>
<LI><TT>aliased symbol already declared</TT>
</LI>
</UL>
