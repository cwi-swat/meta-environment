<h2>5.1 Technology and Architecture of the ASF+SDF Meta-Environment</h2>

<p>So far, we have explained the functionality of the ASF+SDF Meta-Environment&#32;as an
interactive development environment for ASF+SDF&#32;specifications.
There are, however, good reasons to have a look under the hood and
understand the architecture and technologies that have been used:
<ul><li>Both architecture and technologies are very innovative
and it is worthwhile to learn about them.
<li>The ASF+SDF Meta-Environment&#32;has been constructed as a collection of
cooperating components. All of these components have merits of their
own and can be used independently of the ASF+SDF Meta-Environment.
</ul>
<p>If you want to reuse components of the ASF+SDF Meta-Environment&#32;or want to build
variants of it, then the following information is for you.

<h3><a name="id1">5.1.1 Technological Background</a></h3>

<h4><a name="id2">ToolBus</a></h4>
<p>In many large systems control flow and actual computation are complete
entangled. This leads to poor extensibility and maintenance problems.  To
separate coordination from computation we use the ToolBus coordination
architecture&nbsp;<a href="user-manual_55.html#BK98">[2]</a>, a programmable software bus based on process
algebra.  Coordination is expressed by a formal description of the cooperation
protocol between components while computation is expressed in components that
may be written in any language. We thus obtain interoperability of
heterogeneous components in a (possibly) distributed system.

<h4><a name="id3">ATerms</a></h4>
<p>Coordination protocol and components have to share data. We use
ATerms&nbsp;<a href="user-manual_55.html#BJKO00">[8]</a> for this purpose. These are trees with optional annotations on
each node.  The annotations are used to store tool-specific information
like text coordinates or color attributes. The implementation of ATerms
has two essential properties: terms are stored using maximal subterm
sharing (reducing memory requirements and making deep equality tests
very efficient) and they can be exchanged using a very dense binary encoding that
preserves sharing. As a result very large terms (with over <i>1,000,000</i> nodes)
can be processed.

<h4><a name="id4">SGLR</a></h4>
<p>In our language-centric approach the parser is an essential tool.  We
use scannerless, generalized-LR parsing&nbsp;<a href="user-manual_55.html#Vis97">[35]</a>.  In this way we
can parse arbitrary context-free grammars, an essential property when
combining and parsing large grammars for (dialects of) real-world
languages.

<h4><a name="id5">Term rewriting</a></h4>
<p>ASF+SDF&#32;specifications are executed as (conditional) rewrite rules. Both
interpretation and compilation (using the ASF2C compiler&nbsp;<a href="user-manual_55.html#BKO99">[10]</a>) of
these rewrite rules are supported. The compiler generates very efficient
C code that implements pattern matching and term traversal. The generated
code uses ATerms as its main data representation, and ensures a minimal
use of memory during normalization of terms.

<h3><a name="id6">5.1.2 Architecture</a></h3>
<div align="center"><p>
<a name="FIG:architecture">

<div align="center">Architecture of the ASF+SDF Meta-Environment</div>
</a>
</p></div>
The architecture of the ASF+SDF Meta-Environment&#32;is shown <a href="#FIG:architecture">above</a>.
It consists of a ToolBus that interconnects the following components:
<ul><li><b>User interface (GUI)</b>: the top level user-interface of the system.
      It consists primarily of a graph browser for the import graph
      of the current specification. Furthermore, it offers facilities
      to visualize parse trees of selected pieces of parsed texts.
<li><b>Text Editor</b>: a customized version of <tt>XEmacs</tt>&#32;for text editing.
<li><b>Structure Editor</b>: a syntax-directed editor that closely cooperates
with the Text Editor.
<li><b>Parser</b>:  scannerless, generalized-LR parser (SGLR) that is parametrized 
with a parse table.
<li><b>Parsetable generator</b>: takes an SDF syntax definition as input and 
generates a parse table for SGLR.
<li><b>Term Store</b>: stores all terms corresponding to specification 
modules, parse tables, user-defined terms, etc.
<li><b>ASF Compiler</b>: the ASF2C compiler.
<li><b>ASF Interpreter</b>: executes specifiations by direct interpretation.
<li><b>Unparser generator</b>: generates prettyprinters.
</ul>
