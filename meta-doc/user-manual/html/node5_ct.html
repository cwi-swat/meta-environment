You can create new specifications or modify and test existing ones
using the Meta-Environment. Specifications consist of a series of
modules, and individual modules can be edited by invoking editors
for the syntax part and the equations part of a module.
All editing in the Meta-Environment is done by creating
instances of a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">generic syntax-directed editor</SPAN>.

<P>
After each editing operation on a module, its <SPAN  CLASS="textit">implementation</SPAN> is 
updated immediately. It consists of a parser, a pretty printer, and a 
term rewriting system which are all derived from the module automatically.

<P>
A module can be tested by invoking a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">term editor</SPAN> to create and
evaluate terms defined by the module. Term editors use the syntax of the
module for parsing the textual representation of terms and for converting
them to internal format (syntax trees). Also, terms are immediately
highlighted in the editor. The equations of the module are then used
to reduce the terms into normal form.  This result is, in its turn,
converted back to textual form by pretty printing it.
