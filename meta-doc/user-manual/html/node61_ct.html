Prefer Literals</A>
</H4> 

<P>
In the left-hand side of a context-free syntax rule literals (keywords
and/or operators) may be used.  If these literals overlap with  more
general lexical tokens (such as identifier) this causes ambiguities.

<P>
The strategy <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Prefer Literals</SPAN> gives preference to interpretation
as a literal, over interpretation as a more general lexical token.
For instance, the keyword <TT>begin</TT> may be recognized as an identifier
given the lexical definition below[ in Figure&nbsp;]CODE:restrict-id.

<P>
There are two approaches to implement Prefer Literals.

<P>
In the first approach, we can explicitly forbid the recognition of
literals as tokens of a specific sort using the
reject mechanism[ (see Section&nbsp;)]PreferAvoidReject.  
The idea is to define context-free
grammar rules for all literals with the undesired lexical sort (e.g.,
<TT>Id</TT>) in the right-hand side followed by the attribute <TT>reject</TT>.
This is illustrated below[in Figure&nbsp;]CODE:reject-id.
The <TT>reject</TT> attribute
indicates here that the recognition of a keyword as a literal of the sort
<TT>Id</TT> should be rejected. This approach has the major disadvantage
that the addition of a literal in any context-free rule also requires
the addition of a new reject rule for that literal.

<P>

<P>
The second approach is more attractive. The lexical definition of the general
notion that interferes with our literals is written in such a way that it is
only used as a last resort. In other words, it is avoided as much as possible
and is only used when no alternative exists.  
The attribute <TT>avoid</TT> defines precisely this behaviour
(see Preferring, Avoiding or Rejecting Parses[Section&nbsp;]PreferAvoidReject).
The next example[Figure&nbsp;]CODE:avoid-id shows
how the lexical definition of <TT>Id</TT> is attributed with <TT>avoid</TT>.

<P>
Although the first approach is more tedious, it allows more flexibility
than the second one.
