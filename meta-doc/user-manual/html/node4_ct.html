The Asf+Sdf Meta-Environment is an interactive development environment (IDE) for
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">meta programming</SPAN>. It can be used to generate implementations of

<UL>
<LI>compilers,
</LI>
<LI>interpreters,
</LI>
<LI>source-to-source transformers,
</LI>
<LI>source code analyzers,
</LI>
<LI>pretty printers (formatters),
</LI>
<LI>type-checkers,
</LI>
<LI>syntax highlighters,
</LI>
<LI>source code generators,
</LI>
<LI>and even full blown IDE's.
</LI>
</UL>
Typical applications written using the Asf+Sdf Meta-Environmentcover several transitions
from one representation to another (Figure
<A HREF="#FIG:artefacts" TARGET="_top">2</A>)

<P>
The generative process is controlled by a syntax definition of a
(programming) language, and a semantical description of the manipulations
you want to express on the language.

<P>
The Asf+Sdf Meta-Environment can help you if

<UL>
<LI>You have to write a formal specification for some problem
  and you need interactive support to do this.
</LI>
<LI>You have developed your own (application) language and want to
  create an interactive environment for it.
</LI>
<LI>You have programs in some existing programming language and you
   want to analyze or transform them.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The Asf+Sdf Meta-Environment contains a number of formalisms, or domain specific
languages, for the definition of several aspects of a programming
language.  For the syntactic aspect, we have Sdf. For semantical analysis
and transformation, we have Asf. The combination of the two is called
Asf+Sdf.  For pretty-printing, we use the BOXlanguage. Finally,
for fact analysis and elaboration we use RS<SMALL>CRIPT</SMALL>. See Figure
<A HREF="#FIG:architecture" TARGET="_top">61</A> for an overview.

<P>
The four combined formalisms allows the definition of syntactic as
well as semantic aspects of a (programming) language.  It can be used for
the definition of languages. In addition it can be used for the formal
specification of a wide variety of problems. We provide you with:

<UL>
<LI>A general-purpose algebraic specification formalism based on
  equational logic (Asf+Sdf)
</LI>
<LI>Modular structuring of specifications.
</LI>
<LI>Integrated definition of lexical, context-free, and abstract syntax. 
</LI>
<LI>User-defined syntax, allowing you to write specifications using
  your own notation (Sdf)
<A NAME="279"></A>
</LI>
<LI>Complete integration of the definition of syntax and semantics
  (Asf+Sdf)
</LI>
<LI>High-level definition of pretty printers (Asfand BOX)
</LI>
<LI>High-level analysis and fact manipulation. RS<SMALL>CRIPT</SMALL>is a language for the
manipulation of facts encoded as relations. The RS<SMALL>CRIPT</SMALL>language is
relatively new, and is not fully integrated into the Asf+Sdf Meta-Environmentyet.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The Asf+Sdf Meta-Environment IDE offers: 

<UL>
<LI>Syntax-directed editing of Asf+Sdf specifications.
</LI>
<LI>Automatic syntax highlighting.
</LI>
<LI>Testing and interactive debugging of specifications.
</LI>
<LI>Compilation of Asf+Sdf specifications into dedicated commandline tools.
</LI>
<LI>A collection of ready-to-use components that can be composed into 
  your own IDE for any programming language.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The advantages of creating (interactive) environments in this way are twofold:

<UL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Increased uniformity</SPAN>. Similar tools for different
  languages often suffer from a lack of uniformity.  Generating tools
  from language definitions results in a large increase in
  uniformity, with corresponding benefits for the user.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Reduced implementation effort.</SPAN> Preparing a language
  definition requires significantly less effort than developing an
  environment from scratch. The reason is that the domain specific
  languages in the Asf+Sdf Meta-Environmentoffer a higher level of abstraction and
  automation for common language design issues.
