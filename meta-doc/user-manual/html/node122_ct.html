Compiling a Specification
</H2>

<P>
By means of the <TT>Compile ...</TT> button in the
pop-up menu of the import pane the Asf+Sdf2C
compiler can be activated. C code is generated for the selected module
(exactly <EM>one</EM> module can be selected for compilation) including
the imported modules. The C code is immediately compiled into an
executable.

<P>

	<B>Warning</B>:

The specification should be complete, i.e., no missing modules are
allowed, and the equations sections should be error free.

<P>
If this requirement is satisfied, C code can be generated.
This process of C code generation is described in detail in [<A HREF="node129_ct.html#BKO99" TARGET="contents">10</A>].
We shall give a brief description of the main steps performed by the
Asf+Sdf2C compiler.

<P>
In Asf+Sdf there is <EM>no</EM> restriction in which module an equation
is defined, except that all applied syntax rules should be defined.
This freedom asks for a `reshuffling' of the equations given the set of
defined syntax rules. This reshuffling is needed because for each syntax
rule a separate C function is generated. This C function must contain
the C code for <EM>all</EM> equations with the C function as outermost
function symbol in the left-hand side.  By having all equations with the
same outermost function symbol in the left-hand side together an optimal
matching automaton can be generated.  Equations with the same outermost
function symbol are moved to the corresponding syntax rule.
