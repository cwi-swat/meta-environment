<LI>When using the inequality operator <TT>!=</TT> in a condition,
no new variables may be introduced in either side of the inequality.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>If the normal form of a term still contains function symbols
that should have been removed during rewriting, you probably have
forgotten one or more equations that define the function.
A typical situation is that you have given an <SPAN  CLASS="textit">incomplete</SPAN> set of equations
defining the function.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The rewriting process does not stop. Your equations probably contain
an infinite loop.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Be careful when a condition contains both instantiated and 
uninstantiated variables.
