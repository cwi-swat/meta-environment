<P>
This manual is intended for those users that want to write Asf+Sdf specifications. This manual is always under development and we welcome
all feed back and comments.

The focus of this manual will be on how to write Asf+Sdf specifications,
the Asf+Sdf language features are explained as well as some methodology
in using Asf+Sdf when defining a (programming) language. In the last
part of the manual we will address the following technical problems.

<P>

<UL>
<LI>How to compile a specification.

<LI>How to rewrite a term using a compiled specification outside the
Asf+Sdf Meta-Environment.

Finally, we assume the reader has read the Asf+Sdf guided tour and
knows how to use the Asf+Sdf Meta-Environment.

<P>
We do <SPAN  CLASS="textit">not</SPAN> explain in detail:
