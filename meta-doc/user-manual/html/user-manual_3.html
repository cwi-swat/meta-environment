<h2>1.1 When to use the ASF+SDF Meta-Environment?</h2>
<p>

The ASF+SDF Meta-Environment&#32;is an interactive development environment
for the automatic generation of interactive systems for manipulating
programs, specifications, or other texts written in a formal
language. The generation process is controlled by a definition of the
target language, which typically includes such features as syntax,
pretty printing, type checking and execution of programs in the target
language. The ASF+SDF Meta-Environment&#32;can help you if:
<ul>  <li>You have to write a formal specification for some problem
  and you need interactive support to do this.
  <li>You have developed your own (application) language and want to
  create an interactive environment for it.
  <li>You have programs in some existing programming language and you
   want to analyze or transform them.
</ul>
<p>The ASF+SDF&#32;formalism allows the definition of syntactic as well as
semantic aspects of a (programming) language. 
It can be used for the definition of languages (for
programming, for writing specifications, for querying databases, for
text processing, or for dedicated applications). In addition it can be
used for the formal specification of a wide variety of
problems. ASF+SDF&#32;provides you with:
<ul>  <li>A general-purpose algebraic specification formalism based on equational logic. 
  <li>Modular structuring of specifications.
  <li>Integrated definition of lexical, context-free, and abstract syntax. 
  <li>User-defined syntax, allowing you to write specifications using your own notation. 
  <li>Complete integration of the definition of syntax and
  semantics.
</ul>
<p>The ASF+SDF Meta-Environment&#32;offers: 
<ul>  <li>Syntax-directed editing of ASF+SDF&#32;specifications.
  <li>Testing of specifications by means of interpretation.
  <li>Compilation of ASF+SDF&#32;specifications into dedicated
interactive environments containing various tools such as a parser, 
a pretty printer, a syntax-directed editor, a
debugger, and an interpreter or compiler.
</ul>
<p>The advantages of creating interactive environments in this way are twofold:
<ul>  <li><em>Increased uniformity</em>. Similar tools for different
  languages often suffer from a lack of uniformity.  Generating tools
  from language definitions will result in a large increase in
  uniformity, with corresponding benefits for the user.
  <li><em>Reduced implementation effort.</em> Preparing a language
  definition requires significantly less effort than developing an
  environment from scratch.
</ul>
