Preferring, Avoiding or Rejecting Parses
</H3>

<P>
Priorities can be used to define a priority between two functions or between
two groups of functions. In both cases the functions involved have to be
listed explicitly in the priority declaration. In certain cases, however, it
is desirable to define that a single rule has higher or lower priority than
all other functions or to explicitly reject certain syntactic constructs.
The former is achieved by the attributes <TT>prefer</TT> and <TT>avoid</TT>. The
latter by the attribute <TT>reject</TT>. 

<P>
The use of the <TT>reject</TT> attribute leads also to improvements in the 
performance of the parser, see [<A HREF="node129_ct.html#BSVV02" TARGET="contents">17</A>] for more implementation
details.

<P>
If a function <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img38.png"
 ALT="$F$"></SPAN> is attributed with <TT>prefer</TT> and there is a syntactic
ambiguity in which it is involved, only the parse using <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img38.png"
 ALT="$F$"></SPAN> will remain.

<P>
If a function <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img38.png"
 ALT="$F$"></SPAN> is attributed with <TT>avoid</TT> and there is no ambiguity,
then <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img38.png"
 ALT="$F$"></SPAN> will be used. If there is an ambiguity, then <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img38.png"
 ALT="$F$"></SPAN> will be immediately
removed from the set of ambiguities.

<P>
If a function <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img38.png"
 ALT="$F$"></SPAN> is attributed with <TT>reject</TT>, then independently of the
number of ambiguities, the parse using <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img38.png"
 ALT="$F$"></SPAN> will be removed.  While
restrictions[ (Section&nbsp;)]Restrictions
only impose limitations on the
immediate lookahead that follows a symbol, the reject mechanism can be used
to eliminate complicated syntactic structures.

<P>
Examples of the use of <TT>prefer</TT>, <TT>avoid</TT> and <TT>reject</TT> in order
to solve lexical ambiguities are discussed in
Lexical Ambiguities[ Section&nbsp;]lex-ambiguity.
In Context-free Ambiguities[ Section&nbsp;]cf-ambiguity
we will give examples of how to use
these attributes to solve context-free ambiguities, such as the
famous dangling else problem.
