<H1>Scenario Observations</H1>

The <A HREF="scenarios.html">scenarios</A> provide an interesting
view on some of the problems that must be solved in the design.
In this section, we will discuss some of the observations that
can be made from the scenarios.
In particular, we will discuss:
<UL>
<LI> What is the <A HREF="#MinimumToolSet">minimum set of tools</A>
     that is needed to implement the scenarios discussed earlier.
<LI> How should <A HREF="#SyntaxChanges">changes in the syntax</A>
      be propagated.
<LI> How should <A HREF="#ErrorHandling">errors</A> be handled?
</UL>


<H2><A NAME="MinimumToolSet">A Minimum Set of Tools</A></H2>

From the scenarios, we can derive the following minimum set of
tools needed to get the Meta-Environment running:
<UL>
     <LI> A <A HREF="../meta/components.html#control-tool">control tool</A>, 
	  offering the basic user interface functionality
          to control the rest of the system.
     <LI> A <A HREF="../meta/components.html#hybrid-editor">hybrid editor</A>,
	  consisting of two subcomponents,
          the <EM>structured editor</EM> and the <EM>text editor</EM>.
	  An editor instance of the hybrid editor can be used to edit the
	  syntax of a module, the equations of a module, or a term over
          a specific module.
     <LI> A <A HREF="../metA/components.html#parser">parser</A>,
          which can parse terms given a parse table and an input string.
     <LI> A <A HREF="../meta/components.html#parser-generator">parser 
          generator</A>,
	  which can generate parse tables
          giving the complete syntax of a module and its submodules.
     <LI> A <A HREF="../meta/components.html#evaluator">evaluator</A>,
	  which can evaluate a term given an
          input term and a list of equations.
     <LI> A <A HREF="../meta/components.html#compiler">compiler</A>,
          which can compile a specification and
          generate C code for it.
     <LI> A <A HREF="../meta/components.html#module-database">module 
	  database</A>,
          which keeps track of all modules
          and relations between modules in the system.
     <LI> A <A HREF="../meta/components.html#term-database">term database</A>,
          which keeps track of all terms in the system, and acts as an
          <EM>AsFix term cache</EM>, caching the results of parsing terms. 
     <LI> An <A HREF="../meta/components.html#unparser">unparser</A>, 
          which can unparse terms, either to text
          (by updating the layout in the AsFix representation of the term),
          TeX code, or HTML code, given a list consisting of pairs of
          syntax rules and box expressions.
     <LI> An <A HREF="../meta/components.html#unparser-generator">unparser 
          generator</A>, which can generate lists consisting
          of pairs of syntax rules and box expressions.
</UL>

An important design decision is to separate the term database from the
module database. Three issues play a role here:
<UL>
<LI> In stand alone environments, the module database is not needed.
     The cleanest way to implement this is by providing both tools
     in the Meta-Environment, and providing just the term database
     in a stand alone environment.
<LI> Although the functionality offered by these tools will
     overlap significantly (both must have extensive knowledge of
     the AsFix format), this can easily be covered by reusing code
     between these tools.
<LI> Although both tools are used to store and retrieve AsFix
     terms, they are conceptually different entities because changes
     in modules have a much wider impact on the system than changes
     in terms.
</UL>

<H2>Syntax Changes</H2>
A number of important design decisions revolve around when and how far
to propagate changes in the syntax of a module. When the syntax of
a module changes, terms and equations over modules higher in the
module hierarchy need to be reparsed, and it is more than likely that
some of these parses will fail. This means for instance that
equations of some module that (indirectly) imports the changed
module might not be valid anymore, so evaluations over that module
must be disabled until all equations are reparsed.

<P>
There are two major stages in the propagation of changes in the
syntax of an editor.
The first stage is from the editor to the module database.
The second stage is from the module database to the rest of the
system.


<H3>The First Stage in Propagating Syntax Changes</H3>
There are basically four disctinct moments at which the first stage 
of syntax change propagation could occur:
<OL>
<LI> When the user performs a <EM>text editing operation</EM> on
     the syntax of a module. An advantage could be that changes
     are propagated as early as possible, giving all
     user interface components the possibility to keep the user
     informed of the exact state of information they provide.
     A disadvantage is that if the user decides to 'undo' changes
     later on, the system has already adapted to the invalidation
     of the syntax being edited.
<LI> When the user changes the underlying tree, either by performing
     a structure editing operation, or reparsing after a number of
     text editing operation. Again, 'undo' facilities might 
     interfere with the efficient operation of the system.
<LI> When the user explicitly updates the 'official' version of
     the term, for instance by pressing a 'save' button.
     An advantage of this approach
     lies in the fact that the user will be forced to save his/her
     work often. This in turn provides excellent minor synchronization
     points for version management.
     A disadvantage is that the user must remember to save before
     changes take effect, but some form of visual feedback would
     make a huge difference in this area.
<LI> When some tool needs the most up-to-date version of any tree
     that depends on syntax currently being edited, for instance
     when the evaluator wants to evaluate a term, all editors in
     the system are queried to see where the newest version is
     available, and whether this newest version needs reparsing or not.
</OL>

<!--
In the scenarios, we choose for option three but more discussion is
needed on this issue.
- inconsequente versies (sommige wel geupdate, sommige niet)
- in repository alleen boom of text, niet een mengvorm in 1 boom.
- in structure editor wel boom met subtexten.
- herschrijven: evaluator vraagt aan module editor of alle benodigde
  bomen er zijn.
- voorlopig just-in-time, later soms vooruit proberen te werken.

<H3>The Second Stage</H3>
There are basically two styles of propagating the changes in the
syntax of a module to other components, <EM>lazy</EM> 
propagation and <EM>eager</EM> propagation. In lazy propagation,
the changes are only propagated when a component requests the most
up-to-date version of the syntax over a certain module. In eager
propagation, changes are directly propagated when they occur.

<P> The eager propagation has the advantage that the system will
always perform any tasks needed after a syntax change as soon as possible.
For instance, the generation of a new parser is done as soon as the
syntax of a module changes.
But this eagerness also has the big disadvantage that a lot of unnecessary
work will be performed. For instance if the user first edits the syntax
of module A, and then starts to edit the syntax of module B which happens
to be a submodule of A, a parser is generated for module A that is
obsolete before it is even completed!

<P> The lazy propagation has the advantage that only necessary work
will be done. The disadvantage of this approach is that this work 
will be done as late as possible, causing unnecessary delays for
the user. 

<P>Ideally, we want the best of both worlds. No unnecessary
work, but no unnecessary delays either. If we consider an eager
approach, this can be done by interrupting tasks as soon as it is
detected that the result of the tasks will be obsolete. The processing
power already spent is wasted, but at least the user will not have
to wait on results have to be discarded anyway. In the lazy approach,
we can imagine a 'supervisor' that detects when some of the components
of the system are idle (especially when those components run on a
machine that is lightly loaded), and starts preparations of tasks that
the user might want to perform next.

For the time being, we are inclined to choose the lazy approach,
because we feel that this enables a simpler design to which we can
easily add some eager features at a later stage using heuristics 
that are based on observed behaviour of users.

<H2><A NAME="ErrorHandling">Error Handling</A></H2>

A lot of operations in the Asf+Sdf Meta-Environment can fail, sometimes
for unexpected reasons. Handling these failures by anticipating all possible
failures would add a lot of code in the controlling ToolBus script, as
wel as in the different tools.

<P>Another solution would be to abort a particular operation (scenario?)
as soon as an error has been detected. This is an attractive alternative,
because no extensive error propagation has to be done, making it possible
to write short and concise ToolBus scripts. However, this approach does
not take into account that the user must be informed when an operation
fails, and why it fails, so he or she can take action to correct the problem.

<P>We propose to handle this notification to the user by sending 
<EM>error notes</EM> as soon as a problem is detected, and then aborting
the operation. The error note must contain an indication of the
operation that failed, so the correct user interface component can
signal the error to the user.
