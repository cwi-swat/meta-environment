  * Splitted the user manual in a guided tour and a asf+sdf manual.

  * Changed generation of pdf file from using pdflatex to using latex
    and then dvipdf. This is because pdflatex dumps core on manual.ltx
    for some vague reason.

  * Started to adapt the user manual to the new user interface.

  * Based the generation of the manual on pdflatex instead of latex.

2001/08/27 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
  * All source files are now included in the meta-doc distribution
  * Added --with-build-manual configuration switch to explicitely state that
    the manual should be build  (useful for developers).
  * Manual is now installed as asf+sdf-user-manual.ps in <prefix>/doc
  * Added autobundle package description file.


2001/07/31 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Put the user-manual of the ASF+SDF Meta-Environment in a separate
    package.
  * Initial version is 0.1beta
  * make dist creates a tarball containing only manual.ps
