Parse Errors</A>
</H2>
There are three different types of parse errors:

<OL>
<LI>A syntax error, which is reported by pinpointing the exact
location in the file and the message <TT>Parse error near cursor</TT> in case
of an editor or in the message pane an error message similar to
<TT>Parse error: character '&lt;c&gt;' unexpected</TT>.
This means that the parser detected a syntax error in the text to be parsed
and can not proceed its parsing process.
Clicking on the error in the <TT>Errors</TT>-pane moves the cursor to the
exact error location and launches if needed the editor.
A variant of the syntax error message is: <TT>Parse error: eof
unexpected</TT>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>A cycle, in case of an editor the cursor is positioned at the
position where the first cycle is detected in the input and the message
is <TT>Cycle: &lt;list_of_production_rules&gt;</TT> is printed.
A cycle is reported whenever
the parser detects a non terminating chain of reductions.
All production rules on the cycle are shown as <TT>&lt;list_of_production_rules&gt;</TT>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>An ambiguity, again in case of an editor the cursor is
positioned at the position where the first ambiguity is detected in the
input and the message <TT>Ambiguity: &lt;list_of_production_rules&gt;</TT>
is printed. An ambiguity is reported whenever the parser was able to
recognized a (part of) the input sentence in different ways.
The <TT>&lt;list_of_production_rules&gt;</TT> shows all production rules
that are involved in the ambiguity.

<P>
</LI>
</OL>
