Parse Table Generation</A>
</H3>

<P>
Before you can parse terms over a module <TT>M</TT> outside the
Asf+Sdf Meta-Environment you have to obtain a parse table for this module.  
There are currently three ways to achieve this:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Interactively using the Asf+Sdf Meta-Environment by selecting module <TT>M</TT> and pushing the <TT>Term ParseTable...</TT> button in 
the menu <TT>Export</TT> for the module pop-up menu. A window pops up in which
you can select the directory where the parse table will be saved and in
which you have to give the desired name for the table.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>From the command line using the command <TT>pt-dump</TT>.
In the background the same actions are performed as in the interactive
setting, only no user interface is activated. 
If you want to obtain the parse table for <TT>basic/Booleans</TT> 
you can do this via <TT>pt-dump -m basic/Booleans -o Booleans.trm.tbl</TT>.
For further information use <TT>pt-dump -h</TT>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>From the command line using the command <TT>sdf2table</TT>.  You should
be aware that <TT>sdf2table</TT> needs as input the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">complete</SPAN> grammar
of <TT>M</TT>. This means in particular that all imports of <TT>M</TT> should
be expanded before <TT>sdf2table</TT> can be used. Command line tools are
available to do this, but we will not describe them here.

<P>
For further information use <TT>sdf2table -h</TT>.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Before a parse table is generated the Sdf definition is checked with
respect to well-formedness. When using the <TT>sdf2table</TT> only the 
checks on Sdf are performed, in the other two cases the checks
on Sdf and on Asf+Sdf specific features are performed as well.

<P>
