Lexical Syntax
</H2>

<P>
The lexical syntax describes the low level structure of text by means of
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">lexical tokens</SPAN>. A lexical token consists of a sort name (used to
distinguish classes of tokens like identifiers and numbers), and the actual text
of the token. The lexical syntax also defines which substrings of the text are
layout symbols or comments and are to be skipped.

<P>
A lexical syntax contains a set of declarations for <SPAN  CLASS="textit">lexical functions</SPAN>,
each consisting of a regular expression and a result sort. All functions with
the same result sort together define the lexical syntax of tokens of that
sort. Regular expressions may contain any basic symbol and any symbol
operator as described in  Symbols[ Section&nbsp;]Symbols.
Spaces are only significant inside strings and character classes.

<P>
The sort name <TT>LAYOUT</TT> is predefined and may not be redeclared.  
<TT>LAYOUT</TT> defines which parts of the text are <SPAN  CLASS="textit">layout symbols</SPAN> (also
known as <SPAN  CLASS="textit">white space</SPAN>) between lexical tokens and are to be skipped
during lexical analysis. It may only be used as result sort of
lexical functions[ (Section&nbsp;)]LexicalFunctions.
When a string is matched by both a
LAYOUT function and by other non-LAYOUT functions, then the interpretation as
layout symbol is ignored. <TT>LAYOUT</TT> is typically used for defining layout
and comment conventions.

<P>
Traditionally, lexical syntax and context-free syntax are treated
differently.  They are defined by different notations and implemented
by means of different techniques. Sdf provides a much more uniform
treatment.  In Sdf, the only significant difference between the two
is that no layout will be accepted while recognizing the members of
the left-hand side of a lexical function, whereas layout <SPAN  CLASS="textit">will</SPAN>
be accepted between the members of the left-hand side of a
context-free function. At the implementation level, both are
implemented using a single parsing technique.

<P>
Technically, there exist only <SPAN  CLASS="textit">syntax</SPAN> sections. Both lexical
syntax sections and context-free syntax sections are transformed into
such syntax sections after appropriate insertion of optional layout
between the elements of context-free functions. In rare cases,
the specification writer may want to control this process explicitly
and write syntax sections directly. This will not be discussed
in this manual, but further details can be found in [<A HREF="node129_ct.html#Vis97" TARGET="contents">35</A>].
