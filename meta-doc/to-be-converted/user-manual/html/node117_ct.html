In the previous section we have described the overall architecture and very
briefly mentioned the main components of the Meta-Environment. In order to
understand how to build stand-alone environments, it is necessary to 
understand some of the "flow-of-control" and "data-flow" within the
Meta-Environment. There are in fact two main scenarios:

<UL>
<LI>Parsing a term
</LI>
<LI>Reducing a term
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
An integrated environment as the Asf+Sdf Meta-Environment takes
care of a lot of administrative issues when developing your
specifications. For syntax editors a fixed parse table will
be used, namely a parse table derived from the SDF grammar.
But when you invoke an equation or term editor 
and hit the parse button, the environment will generate a 
parse table, if necessary, before parsing the equations or 
term. In order to do that the underlying syntax definition 
will be checked on completeness and well-formedness, and if 
this is the case the parse table will be generated and stored 
in a repository. This storing of the parse table is just for 
caching.

<P>
If you select the reduce button in a term editor all relevant
equations have to be parsed, checked and combined into one list
in order to be used by the interpreter for rewriting the term.

<P>
These parse tables and list of equations play an important
role in the stand-alone setting.
