In the Asf+Sdf Meta-Environment, equations can be executed as <SPAN  CLASS="textit">rewrite rules</SPAN>.  The
above equation is thus executed as the rewrite rule <!-- MATH
 $L \rightarrow R$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="52" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img66.png"
 ALT="$L \rightarrow R$"></SPAN>. This
can be used to reduce some initial closed term (i.e., not containing
variables) to a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">normal form</SPAN> (i.e., a term that is not reducible any
further) by repeatedly applying rules from the specification.

<P>
A term is always reduced in the context of a certain module, say <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="21" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img7.png"
 ALT="$M$"></SPAN>. The
rewrite rules that may be used for the reduction of the term are the rules
declared in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="21" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img7.png"
 ALT="$M$"></SPAN> itself and in the modules that are (directly or indirectly)
imported by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="21" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img7.png"
 ALT="$M$"></SPAN>.

<P>
The search for an applicable rule is determined by the reduction strategy,
that is, the procedure used to select a subterm for possible reduction. In our
case the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">leftmost-innermost</SPAN> reduction strategy is used. This means that a
left-to-right, depth-first traversal of the term is performed and that for
each subterm encountered an attempt is made to reduce it.

<P>
Next, the rules are traversed one after the other.  The textual order of the
rules is irrelevant.  Instead they are ordered according to their
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">specificity</SPAN>: more specific rules come before more general rules and
default equations[ (see Section&nbsp;)]DefaultEquations come last.  
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Independent of the specificity, a specification should always be
confluent and terminating.</SPAN>

<P>
If the selected subterm and the left-hand side of a
rule (more precisely: of the left-hand side of its conclusion) match, we say
that a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">redex</SPAN> has been found and the following happens. The conditions
of the rule are evaluated and if the evaluation of a condition fails, other
rules (if any) with matching left-hand sides are tried.  If the evaluation of
all conditions succeeds, the selected subterm is replaced by the right-hand
side of the rule (more precisely: the right-hand side of the conclusion of the
rule) after performing proper <SPAN  CLASS="textit">substitutions</SPAN>. Substitutions come into
existence by the initial matching of the rule and by the evaluation of its
conditions.  For the resulting term the above process is repeated until no
further reductions are possible and a normal form is reached (if any).
