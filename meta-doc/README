This package contains the user-manual of the ASF+SDF Meta-Environment. If
you are interested in reading/installing the documentation only from the
meta-doc distribution simply run:

> ./configure --prefix=<installation-prefix> 
> gmake install

to install the ASF+SDF user manual in <installation-prefix>/doc. 


If you are a developer and obtained the meta-doc pacakge from CVS or
if you explicitely want to rebuild the manual run:

> ./reconf (only needed when you obtained meta-doc from CVS)
> ./configure --prefix=<installation-prefix> --with-build-manual
> gmake 
> gmake install

to build and install the ASF+SDF user manual in <installation-prefix>/doc.

If you forget to specify the --with-build-manual switch and, during
configuration, the user manual does not yet exist, the system is configured
to automatically build the manual.

Use gimp to make the screen dumps, when saving use the same width as given
in the document. To make the gif pictures use:
<path-to-hyperlatex>/ps2gif -notrans picture,ps
mv picture.gif html

Beware to 'setenv HYPERLATEX_DIR <path-to-hyperlatex>'

Installing on the webserver:
ssh build-www 
cd /cwi/www/sites/www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/meta/doc

cp manual.ps.gz /usr/local/www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/meta/doc/.
