This package contains the user-manual of the ASF+SDF Meta-Environment. If
you are interested in reading/installing the documentation only from the
meta-doc distribution simply run:

> ./configure --prefix=<installation-prefix> 
> gmake install

to install the ASF+SDF user manual in <installation-prefix>/doc. 


If you are a developer and obtained the meta-doc pacakge from CVS or
if you explicitely want to rebuild the manual run:

> ./reconf (only needed when you obtained meta-doc from CVS)
> ./configure --prefix=<installation-prefix> --with-build-manual
> gmake 
> gmake install

to build and install the ASF+SDF user manual in <installation-prefix>/doc.

If you forget to specify the --with-build-manual switch and, during
configuration, the user manual does not yet exist, the system is configured
to automatically build the manual.
