=head1 NAME

SDF2TABLE - generate parse tables from SDF2 language definitions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<sdf2table> [-B<bfh>] [-B<i> I<file>] [-B<ln>] [-B<o> I<file>] [-B<tvVx>] file0 ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<sdf2table> parses SDF2 syntax definitions, normalizes them to Kernel
SDF2, and constructs the corresponding parse table.

A number of options can be supplied; these are as follows:

=over 4

=item B<-b>

Write term output in BAF (Binary AsFix) format. This is the default.

=item B<-f>

Use the handcrafted -- `fast' -- normalizer.  This is the default.

=item -B<h>

Displays concise usage information.

=item -B<i> I<file>

Read input from F<file>; by default, input is either read from stdin,
or from the named files supplied as arguments.

Write output to F<file>.  By default, output is written to file with a
name derived from the name of the input file for named files, and to
standard output on input from standard input.

=item B<-s>

Use the generated -- `slow' -- normalizer.

=item B<-t>

Write term output in plain text format.

=item B<-v>

Operate in verbose mode.

=head1 NOTES

Expected input for sdf2table is a full, flattened SDF2 specification in
a single file.  In such a file, all modules for the language defined
are present; each module is identified by "module <ModuleName>", and
at the top the keyword "definition" identifies the consecutive list
of modules as a full SDF2 specification.

The normalizer expects a top-level module to be present by the name of
"Main".  Failure to include such a module will yield the parse table
for the empty grammar.
