    <h1>Sdf1 to Sdf2 Conversion</h1>

<p>The new Asf+Sdf Meta-Environment is based on a new version of <em>Sdf</em>
(syntax definition formalism).
If you have an Asf+Sdf language definition developed with the old 
Asf+Sdf Meta-Environment you have to perform some (simple) 
modifications.

<p>The main differences between Sdf1 and Sdf2 are in the range of
lexical disambiguation.

    <h2>Lexical and Syntactic Modifications</h2>

       <ul>
          <li>All characters not being a (uppercase) letter or a digit have
              to be escaped.
          <p>Sdf1: [!@#$%^] -> StrangeChar
          <p>Sdf2: [\!\@\#\$\%\^] -> StrangeChar

          <p>This has also effect on the way the layout characters are
             defined, the space character must be escaped.
          <p>Sdf1: [ \n\t\r] -> LAYOUT
          <p>Sdf2: [\ \n\t\r] -> LAYOUT

          <li>The syntax of priority section in Sdf1 is changed:
              <ul>
                 <li>The keyword "context-free" is added to "priorities".
                 <li>Only the ascending priority changes are supported.
                 <li>The abbreviations are no longer supported.
              </ul>
              <p>Example in Sdf1:
                  priorities "|" < "$"
       </ul>
