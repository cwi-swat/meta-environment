  <section>
    <title>Introduction and discussion</title>

    <para>Since The Meta-Environment is a product family, of which also
    sub-components are released, this document describes the planning for
    components as well as products in The Meta-Environment. Work on The
    Meta-Environment can be categorized:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Programming - Implementing (new) features</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Refactoring - Improving non-functional quality attributes</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Fixing Bugs - Fixing known issues that are registered the
        Bugzilla system</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Documenting - Producing user-documentation and other
        documents</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Building - Work on the build and configuration
        environment</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Deployment - Work on continous integration and deployment, this
        includes manual testing</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The work on The Meta-Environment, and thus its releases, are driven
    mostly by research. Deadlines for papers about components of The
    Meta-Environment, or using components of The Meta-Environment, provide the
    basic structure for this planning. These deadlines may be self-imposed or
    provided from outside. In any case, the above categories of work organize
    naturally around these kinds of deadlines. For example: when writing a
    research paper there is no time for Refactoring, other kinds of
    Documentation, the Build environment, or Deployment. The focus is then
    simply on Programming and Fixing Bugs. On the other hand, Refactoring and
    Documenting are done during explorative research and Friday afternoons,
    when time seems more abundant.</para>

    <para>Since research deadlines are induced on a personal level (of the
    researchers/programmers), they can be very dynamic (read irregular). One
    could say that this makes planning impossible, but we still want to get
    things done. Therefore, the contents of this planning are the
    responsability of all programmers: please check it, execute it, adapt
    it.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Risks</title>

      <para>There are two risks that this document intends to mitigate:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>There will never be a release</emphasis>, because
          research always gets higher priority than the software. The effect
          is a large disinvestment in software that is written, debugged and
          maintained but never used outside of the development team. This will
          also harm users of the software that either use The Meta-Environment
          for their teaching, research or commercial activities.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Research deadlines are not met</emphasis>, because
          the software prohibits easy experimentation. This may be caused by
          badly maintained, buggy or undocumented software. The effect is
          missed deadlines, and a possible disinvestment in a laboratory
          designed for experimental research in language analysis and
          transformation that can not be used for experimental
          research.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>These two risks influence each other. I think it is safe to assume
      that software quality generally decreases when working on research
      deadlines, and it generally improves when working towards releasing the
      software. Still, for doing good research, you need good software, and
      for good software you need good research. Finding the proper balance is
      a dynamic process that needs constant monitoring and assessment.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Efficiency</title>

      <para>To walk the line, we have invested and keep investing in making
      our software process more efficient. Standardization on the ATerm
      data-type is one trick that worked. Code generation has also been a
      successful method in increasing efficiency. Another success is the
      continous integration and release system Sisyphus.</para>

      <para>However, the most imporant method to make releases of The
      Meta-Environment possible is version management. Please read this
      document: version management. By keeping low code quality experiments on
      separate branches we facilitate experimentation without jeopardizing the
      quality of the trunk.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Deliverables</title>

      <para>We deliver the following products, which are all compositions of
      one or several of our components, including the respective
      documentation:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>ATerm library in C</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>ATerm library in Java</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>ApiGen code generator</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>SDF ApiGen: SDF front-end for ApiGen</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>JJTraveler: tree traversal library for Java</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>ToolBus in C, including adapters</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>ToolBus in Java, including adapters</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>SDF: parser generator and parser libraries and tools,
          including the sdf-library of grammars for programming
          languages</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Asc-support: the run-time environment for compiled ASF+SDF
          specifications</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>ASF+SDF Meta-Environment: the programming environment for
          ASF+SDF</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Sisyphus continous integration system</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Know that all releases of The Meta-Environment are accompanied by
      at least a full source code distribution. Binary distributions are
      complementary, and based on the availability of platforms to generate
      the distributions on. A delivered source code distribition has:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>a tested build environment (configure script and
          Makefiles)</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>the full source code of the product</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>documentation online at www.meta-environment.org</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>and a link to the tarball on the
          www.meta-environment.org</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Versions</title>

      <para>Each released product has a human readable version number:
      &lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;patchlevel&gt;. These numbers are
      maintained with the top-level component of each product. This implies
      that the version of the top-level component identifies the version
      number of the product, and that each product must have a single
      top-level component.</para>

      <para>Release Candidates are releases of products that are incomplete,
      but testable and possibly usable by end-users. The intention is to get
      early feedback from a less prejudices audience than ourselves. The
      version scheme is
      &lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;-RC&lt;candidate-number&gt;.</para>

      <para>Continous releases (See Sisyphus) have generated version numbers
      based on the Subversion repository version and the Sisyphus Build
      identifier.</para>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Planning</title>

    <para>Each release has a section, in order of planned release date. Please
    remember that we do not promise to do any of these tasks. This is just our
    planning. It may change.</para>
