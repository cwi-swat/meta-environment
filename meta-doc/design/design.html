<H2>Introduction</H2>
We are currently designing and implementing a modular and extensible
system for designing language specifications in the
<A HREF="http://www.springer.co.uk/ewic/workshops/ASFSDF97/">
Asf+Sdf specification formalism</A>, and automatically generating
programming environments from these specifications.
Our work is based on the knowledge and experience gained with
<A HREF="http://www.wins.uva.nl/pub/programming-research/reports/1995/P9504/">
the old Asf+Sdf Meta-Environment</A>. Instead of redesigning or restructuring 
the monolithic implementation of the old Meta-Environment, we aim at 
creating a number of independent but cooperating tools that can be 
connected using the ToolBus coordination architecture. 

<P>
We are not trying to build one frozen application, but instead we
want to create a family of systems that can be constructed by combining
the components in several combinations, which together will provide
the functionality needed for a specific application. We aim at creating
a system that is flexible enough to allow future experiments in a 
research environment, yet stable enough to be used in industrial strength 
applications.

<P>
We will start by presenting some of the applications we have in mind,
and we will discuss in detail the functionality these application should offer.
We will present the basic architecture that is used to build these 
applications.
We will describe the individual components and their interaction in
complex applications. We will show how these components can be combined in 
different configurations to implement the envisioned applications.

<H2>Range of applications</H2>
All applications that we are interested in building are based on
the Asf+Sdf Meta-Environment. This environment enables the user to
specify the syntax and semantics of computer languages, and to 
interactively generate programming environments for these languages.
Such a generated environment can consist of a completely interactive
program development environment consisting of a structure editor,
typechecker, interpreter and compiler, or it can be more batch oriented
providing tools to do large scale program transformations or code analysis.
The old Asf+Sdf Meta-Environment has been developed based on languages 
like Pico and Mini-ML (our favorite toy languages), and Pascal.
However, the application domain of the Meta-Environment is enlarging to a more 
general
field. Although the applications are still language oriented. The 
Meta-Environment is currently
intensively used in the field of re-engineering and it has to deal with huge 
grammars like
COBOL and huge amounts of code to be analyzed and processed. Furthermore, 
applications
like program transformation systems, for instance for Prolog, 
are developed with Asf+Sdf as well.
Such a system demands other functionality and features, such as flexibility of 
transformation
rule selection, history recording, undo facilities to name a few, than a 
re-engineering system
for COBOL.  
In the next subsections, we will try to give an impression of the 
programming environments that we are interested in.

<H3>Asf+Sdf Meta-Environment</H3>
The Asf+Sdf specification that is to be the basis of a generated
environment needs to be developed using a 
programming environment itself, which contains many of the same components as
the environment that is eventually generated. This environment is
called the 'Asf+Sdf Meta-Environment'. This is an application that is the most
important of all, because all generated environments are based on it.
Components of this Meta-Environment are reused as-is when generating
new environments and all design decisions impact the generated environments
as well as the Meta-Environment itself. We have a description
of the 
<A HREF="meta/features.html">
functionality that this Meta-Enviroment has to offer</A>.
We also present a number of <A HREF="scenarios/scenarios.html">scenarios</A>.
Given these scenarios some
<A HREF="scenarios/observations.html">observations</A> can be made
concerning the tools and functionality of the new Meta-Environment.

<P> It must be 
possible to
parameterize the Meta-Environment with a language definition. In this way we 
will be able
to redesign Asf+Sdf in the (near) future and add language features like higher 
order
functionality, monads, parametrized modules, etc.

<H3>Basic interactive programming environment</H3>
The most typical of generated environments is a so called 'basic 
programming environment' containing a syntax directed editor, a parser,
a typechecker, an interpreter, and a pretty printer. 
The user of such an enviroment can
type in programs using the syntax directed editor, use the typechecker
to check the type correctness of the programs, use the interpreter
to run the program and use the pretty printer to see the results.

<H3>Batch oriented tools</H3>
It should also be possible to use generated components in a
batch oriented fashion. For instance, a compiler that is part of
a generated interactive environment should also be available as
a standalone tool so large amounts of source code can be
compiled automatically in a batch oriented way.

<H3>Extensibility</H3>
Not all behaviour of the generated environments can be specified
accurately and concisely using the Asf+Sdf formalism. Especially
application specific extensions of the user interface and interactions
with components outside the Asf+Sdf Meta-Environment, e.g., proof checkers,
are difficult, if not impossible to foresee.
This means that the generated environments should not be
final and closed, but rather open and extensible. Important in this
respect is that extensions and modifications made by the user should be
preserved when the environment is regenerated.

<P> Furthermore, a number of tools, e.g., compiler, parser generator, and
unparser generator, should be usable as independent components as well.
They should be usable in different systems.
Systems not developed using or based on Asf+Sdf, the Meta-Environment,
and the ToolBus.
