<H2>Introduction</H2>
We are currently designing and implementing a modular and extensible
system for designing languages specifications in the
<A HREF="http://www.springer.co.uk/ewic/workshops/ASFSDF97/">
Asf+Sdf specification formalism</A>, and automatically generating
programming environments from these specifications.
Our work is based on the knowledge and experience gained with
<A HREF="http://www.wins.uva.nl/pub/programming-research/reports/1995/P9504/">
the old Asf+Sdf Meta-environment</A>. Instead of redesigning or restructuring 
the monolithic implementation of the old Meta-environment, we aim at 
creating a number of independent but cooperating tools that can be 
connected using the ToolBus coordination architecture. 

<P>
We are not trying to build one frozen application, but instead we
want to create a family of systems that can be constructed by combining
the components in several combinations, which together will provide
the functionality needed for a specific application. We aim at creating
a system that is flexible enough to allow future experiments in a 
research environment, yet stable enough to be used in industrial strength 
applications.

<P>
We will start by presenting some of the applications we have in mind,
and we will discuss in detail the functionality these application should offer
We will present the basic architecture that is used to build these 
applications.
We will describe the individual components and their interaction in
complex applications. We will show how these components can be combined in 
different configurations to implement the envisioned applications.

<H2>Range of applications</H2>
All applications that we are interested in building are based on
the Asf+Sdf Meta-environment. This environment enables the user to
specify the syntax and semantics of computer languages, and to 
interactively generate programming environments for these languages.
Such a generated environment can consist of a completely interactive
program development environment consisting of a structure editor,
typechecker, interpreter and compiler, or it can be more batch oriented
providing tools to do large scale program transformations or code analyzing.
The old Asf+Sdf Meta-Environment has been develop based on languages like Pico 
and Pascal.
However, the application domain of the Meta-Environment is enlarged to a more 
general
field. Although the applications are still language oriented. The 
Meta-Environment is currently
intensively used in the field of re-engineering and it has to deal with huge 
grammars like
COBOL and huge amounts of code to be analyzed and processed. Furthermore, 
applications
like program transformation systems, like for Prolog, are developed with 
Asf+Sdf as well.
Such a system demands other functionality and features, such as flexibility of 
transformation
rule selection, history recording, undo facilities to name a few, than a 
re-engineering system
for COBOL.  
In the next subsections, we will try to give an impression of the 
programming environments that we are interested in.

<H3>Asf+Sdf Meta-environment</H3>
The Asf+Sdf specification that is to be the basis of a generated
environment needs to be developed using a 
programming environment itself, which contains many of the same components as
the environment that is eventually generated. This environment is
called the 'Asf+Sdf Meta-environment'. This is an application that is the most
important of all, because all generated environments are based on it.
Components of this Meta-environment are reused as-is when generating
new environments and all design decisions impact the generated environments
as well as the Meta-environment itself. We have a description
of the 
<A HREF="meta/features.html">
functionality that this Meta-enviroment has to offer</A>.
We also present a number of <A HREF="scenarios/parse.html">scenarios</A>.

<P> Although the name of the Meta-Environment suggests otherwise, it must be 
possible to
parameterize the Meta-Environment with a language definition. In this way we 
will be able
to redesign Asf+Sdf in the (near) future and add language features like higher 
order
functionality, monads, parametrized modules, etc.

<H3>Basic programming environment</H3>
The most typical of generated environments is a so called 'basic 
programming environment' containing a syntax directed editor, a parser,
a typechecker and an interpreter. The user of such an enviroment can
type in programs in the syntax directed editor, use the typechecker
to check the type correctness of the programs, and the interpreter
to run the program and see the results.

<H3>Standalone tools</H3>
Not only complete environments can be generated, but also simple
standalone tools. For instance, it should be possible to generate
a complete programming environment for a new language, but it should
also be possible to use just the compiler to compile programs in a
batch oriented manner.

<H3>Extensibility</H3>
Not all behaviour of the generated enviroments can be specified
accurately and concisely using the Asf+Sdf formalism. Especially
user interface extensions and interactions with components outside
the Asf+Sdf Meta-environment are difficult, if not impossible to
express. This means that the generated environments should not be
final and closed, but rather open and extensible. Important in this
respect is that modifications done by the user should be kept
intact when the environment is regenerated so the user does not
need to redo the changes over and over again.
