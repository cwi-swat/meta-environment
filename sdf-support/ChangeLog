 * Using const char* in all ToolBus communication


Mon Feb  2 16:43:59 CET 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * fix Makefile.am to get "distcheck" working

2003/01/13 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added dependency on error-support

2003/12/11 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Introduced the {lexical, context-free} start-symbols in the Sdf2 grammar. 

2003/10/09 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * By accident the strategy symbol was removed, added again.

2003/10/08 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Bumped into version 2.0
 * Adapted package dependency.

2003/10/07 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Added "tuple" (<A,B>) besides A#B, but the latter is mapped to
   pt-tuple instead of pt-pair.

2003/10/02 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Removed the set and perm symbol, in the library of course.
   Regenerated the Sdf.label.def and the rest.

2003/10/01 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Regenerated from a dump from Sdf2 in the library with constructor
   and labels.

2003/09/26 ({jurgenv,jong}@cwi.nl)

   fixed a compiler warning in it.
 
2003/09/25 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Made robust against the absence of correct modules.

2003/09/23 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added label support.

2003/08/01 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * SDFProductionToPtProduction does not abort anymore after encountering
   a production it can not convert. A message is printed and NULL is 
   returned instead.

2003/08/01 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Set version to 1.1.2
 * Added new functionality to derive the direct dependencies of
   modules.

2003/06/26 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added package definition file

2003/06/25 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added computation of new module names based on a search path to
   the sdf-modules tool. This is used to support compound module names,
   the user can select a path to a module name and the system computes
   which part is the path to the module name and which part should be
   the compound module name.

 * Added SDF_concatRenamingList
 * Changed order of includes in utils/src/sdf-modules

 * Fixed numerous bugs in the implementation of getTransitiveImports:
     - forgot to remove position info once again
     - compound symbols not dealt with correctly
     - renaming in parameters went wrong when there were no parameters

2003/05/30 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Introduced src directories for sdf-modules and sdf-renaming
 * Fixed bug: transitive imports could not deal with circular imports
   (this also improved the efficiency quite alot)
 * Optimized transitive imports to do as less work as possible using the
   result cache.
 * Implemented transitive closure based on pure ATerm representation of the
   import relation 
 * getDependingModules based on new transitive closure, not on complete 
   modules anymore

2003/05/28 ({jong,jurgenv,markvdb}@cwi.nl)
 * utils/sdf-modules/sdf-modules.c: ATBpack added to make_sdf_definition

   doesn't work at the moment but the code looks nicer.

2003/05/26 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)

   and returns a list of parse trees accordingly. This code is based on
   the old asf-operations and elan-operations tool and designed to replace
   it.
 * Added get-all-imported-modules to the sdf-modules tool that does not
   return a list of imported module names, but the modules themselves
  
2003/05/21 ({markvdb,jurgenv}@cwi.nl)
 * Fixed a large number of bugs in sdf-modules.

2003/05/19 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Renamed the sdf-tool to sdf-modules.
 * Moved SDF2 functionality from the old module-db in the meta package to
   the new sdf-modules tool.

2003/05/17 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added dependency on toolbuslib

   ToolBus interface to the support library
  
2003/04/29 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
