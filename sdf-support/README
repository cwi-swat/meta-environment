SDF Support

Installation Instructions
=========================

1) Required packages.

   -GNU make, available from:
      www.gnu.org

   -See the file ./package for the dependencies

2) Configuring SDF Support.

   Assuming that all dependencies are present in your PATH, then
   the following command will configure SDF Support accordingly: 

    ./configure --prefix=<sdf-support> 

   Note. Default behaviour of configure is that it will look for libraries               in <prefix>/lib and for executables in your search paths. So,                   you do not need to specify the locations of all these packages                  explicitly.

   If you use gcc, sglr is built with "gcc -Wall -g -O2". If you prefer
   different options use --with-cflags="<options>" when you run configure.

   ./configure --help gives a detailed list of configuration options.    

3) Building SDF Support.

   Assuming that GNU make is called "gmake" on your system then the
   following commands will build and install SDF Support:

   gmake
   gmake install

4) Checking SDF Support.

   SDF Support can be tested via:

   gmake check
