 * library/basic/{Pair,Set}Con.sdf: added

Fri Feb  2 11:40:48 CET 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * languages/c: renamed to ansi-c to prevent confusion. The idea is to
   include a iso-c-99 grammar in the near future.

2007-01-03    <storm@cwi.nl>

  * library/basic/RStores: Integer, not IntCon is a now an RElem.
  * library/basic/IntCon: added priorities to disallow ---++-+n Integers. 


2006-12-14    <storm@cwi.nl>

  * library/basic/RStores.sdf: imported basic/BoolCon.

  * library/basic/RStores.sdf: Renamed cons/label attributes to
    prevent name clashes with ATerm and Java identifiers when
    generating a Java API using apigen. 


2006-12-14    <storm@cwi.nl>

 * library/basic/Rstores.sdf: changed "name" labels to "type-name" and
   "parameter-name" respectively, as it bites sdf2-to-java generated
   apis.

2006-12-13    <storm@cwi.nl>
 * library/basic/Rstores.sdf: made a proper syntax (with curlies and all), and
   added cons attributes and labels for imploded apigen.
 * library/basic/IntCon: added module with lexical syntax for possibly
   negative integer constants.

Mon Nov 13 10:42:34 CET 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * library/languages/sdf2/syntax/{Properties,Nullables,RightNullables}.sdf:
   removed and implemented in the branch: enable-rn-analysis.

Tue Oct 31 13:56:32 CET 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * library/basic/BoolCon.sdf: removed BoolAnd, BoolOr and stuff because
   that breaks the bootstrap process, and it is not used by
   basic/Booleans anyway.
 * library/basic/Configuration.sdf: added support for all kinds of
   mouse clicks

Mon Oct 16 10:05:08 CEST 2006 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * library/languages/java:
   - Added Java grammar

Wed Sep 27 15:57:01 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * library/languages/sdf2/syntax/Nullables.sdf: Modified syntax to work with
   Productions instead of Symbols.

Wed Sep 13 15:57:47 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * library/languages/sdf2/syntax/Properties.sdf: Added Properties production 
   to be consistent with other definitions.

Wed Sep  6 16:06:42 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * library/languages/sdf2/syntax/{Properties,Nullables,RightNullables}.sdf:
   added a new type of 'Grammar' which contains derived facts from
   SDF2 syntax definitions. These facts may be used by static checkers
   or by the parse table generator. So far, we have a list of all
   nullable non-terminals, and a list of all right nullable productions.
   This will be used for constructing RN tables for the RNGLR algorithm.

Mon Feb 13 13:47:36 CET 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * package: Initial version 1.0
 * library: Copied all syntax definitions from asf-library
