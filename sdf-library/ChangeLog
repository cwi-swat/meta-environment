 * library/languages/sdf2/syntax/Nullables.sdf: Modified syntax to work with
   Productions instead of Symbols.

Wed Sep 13 15:57:47 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * library/languages/sdf2/syntax/Properties.sdf: Added Properties production 
   to be consistent with other definitions.

 * library/languages/sdf2/syntax/{Properties,Nullables,RightNullables}.sdf:
   added a new type of 'Grammar' which contains derived facts from
   SDF2 syntax definitions. These facts may be used by static checkers
   or by the parse table generator. So far, we have a list of all
   nullable non-terminals, and a list of all right nullable productions.
   This will be used for constructing RN tables for the RNGLR algorithm.
