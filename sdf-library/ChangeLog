 * library/languages/sdf2/syntax/{Properties,Nullables,RightNullables}.sdf:
   removed and implemented in the branch: enable-rn-analysis.

Tue Oct 31 13:56:32 CET 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * library/basic/BoolCon.sdf: removed BoolAnd, BoolOr and stuff because
   that breaks the bootstrap process, and it is not used by
   basic/Booleans anyway.
 * library/basic/Configuration.sdf: added support for all kinds of
   mouse clicks

Mon Oct 16 10:05:08 CEST 2006 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * library/languages/java:
   - Added Java grammar

Wed Sep 27 15:57:01 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * library/languages/sdf2/syntax/Nullables.sdf: Modified syntax to work with
   Productions instead of Symbols.

Wed Sep 13 15:57:47 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * library/languages/sdf2/syntax/Properties.sdf: Added Properties production 
   to be consistent with other definitions.

Wed Sep  6 16:06:42 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * library/languages/sdf2/syntax/{Properties,Nullables,RightNullables}.sdf:
   added a new type of 'Grammar' which contains derived facts from
   SDF2 syntax definitions. These facts may be used by static checkers
   or by the parse table generator. So far, we have a list of all
   nullable non-terminals, and a list of all right nullable productions.
   This will be used for constructing RN tables for the RNGLR algorithm.

 * package: Initial version 1.0
 * library: Copied all syntax definitions from asf-library
