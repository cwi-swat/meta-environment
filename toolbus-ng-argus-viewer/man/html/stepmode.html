<h1>Stepmode</h1>

<br>

<p>
With the stepmode, it is posible to execute a Toolbus script by a single line at a time. 
This way the behaviour of the script will be easier to follow. With each step, the last 
executed codeline will be highlighted in the source view.
</p>

<p>
Besides highlighting the the codeline, the MSC will also be updated at every step allowing you 
to see what communication between processes/tools takes place.
