<h1>Tool List</h1>

<p>
The tool list is an overview of the currently active tools that are running.  The tool list has the following functionality:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Grouping tool instances</li>
  <li>Showing/Hiding tools in other views</li>
</ul>

<p>
  
  <h2>Grouping tool instances</h2>

When a tool has only one instance, it will be displayed as a regular item in the tool list. 
When a tool has multiple instances, the instances will be grouped together into a tool group. 
Multiple instances will all be shown by default but by double clicking on the parent tool, all the
tool instances will be represented as one single group.
</p>

<p>
  <h2>Showing/Hiding tools in other views</h2>

The checkbox next to the tool depicts wether or not it is visible in other views. Also by selecting a
tool in this view, the same process will be highlighted in other views. For example the selected tool
in the Tool List will be drawn green in the MSC.
