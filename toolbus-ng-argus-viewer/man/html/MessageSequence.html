<h1>Message Sequence Chart</h1>

<br>

The Message Sequence Chart (MSC) is an overview of the running processes and tools. The communication
is shown aswell as the executed statements.<br>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>
When executing a Toolbus script, all the communication between processes /tools is drawn in the MSC. When
debugging a Toolbus script, you are able to see the actions that took place by the script. This can be done either 
after running a entire Toolbus script, or after taking some steps through the script using the stepmode. The number 
of actions that took place can be set. See User Settings for more information. 
</p>

<h2>How it looks</h2>
<p>
Processes (Circles) and tools (rectangles)  are visualized in the MSC as vertical swimlanes. Executed statements and 
the communication between the processes/tools are displayed on the swimlanes. Whenever a process or tool instance has 
ended, it will not be be removed from the MSC. Instead the displayed process or tool instance will turn grey.
</p>

<p>
The communication between processes/tools are dispayed as horizontal lines and a text that represent the 
communication. The displayed lines differ for the different kinds of communication (asynchrone and synchrone).
</p>

<h2>Displaying filtered processes/tools</h2>
<p>
When a process or tool has communication with a hidden process/tool (because it is filtered), the communication 
line points to a swimlane at the side of the screen. Now by holding the mouse over the swimlane at the side of the 
screen, a tooltip appears holding the name of the hidden process or tool.
