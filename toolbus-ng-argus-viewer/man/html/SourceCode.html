<h1>Sourcecode View</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
In the sourcecode view the current Toolbus script can be viewed. When using the stepmode, the last executed 
codeline will be highlighted in this view. The Source code view can also be used to set breakpoints in the code.
Please note that breakpoints can only be set on statements, breakpoints on nonstatements will be ignored. See
"Breakpoints"  in the Debugging section for more information on breakpoints.
</p>

<h2>Getting process sourcecode</h2>
<p>
The Sourcecode view can also be used directly from the Process List view to get the declaration of a process.
This can be done by double clicking on a process in the Process List.
