<h1>Process List</h1>

<p>
The process list is an overview of the currently active processes that are running.  The process tree has the following functionality:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Grouping process instances</li>
  <li>Setting/Unsetting process breakpoints</li>
  <li>Showing/Hiding processes in other views</li>
  <li>Displaying source code breakpoints</li>
</ul>

<p>
  
  <h2>Grouping process instances</h2>

When a process has only one instance, it will be displayed as a regular item in the process tree. 
When a process has multiple instances, the instances will be grouped together into a process group. 
Multiple instances will all be shown by default but by double clicking on the parent process, all the
process instances will be represented as one single group.
</p>

<p>
  
  <h2>Setting/Unsetting process breakpoints:</h2>

Process breakpoints can be set on process instances. Clicking on the breakpoint column will either set or unset the process breakpoint. 
If there are multiple instances of a process and a process instance is set, the process group will also display a breakpoint icon,
 depicting that one of it's instances has a process breakpoint.


<p>
  <h2>Showing/Hiding processes in other views</h2>

The checkbox next to the process depicts wether or not it is visible in other views. Also by selecting a
process in this view, the same process will be highlighted in other views. For example the selected process
in the Process List will be drawn green in the MSC and used in the Process Details view as the selected process. 


<p>
  <h2>Displaying source code breakpoints</h2>

The process tree will display wether or not a process has a source code breakpoint. When there is only one instance of a process, 
this icon will appear next to it. When there are several instances of the process, the icon is placed next to the process group.
