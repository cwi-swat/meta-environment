<h1>Stepping through a script</h1>

<br>

Instead of letting the Toolbus Viewer execute the entire Toolbus script, the Toolbus Viewer can also be used to step through a Toolbus script. When the button "Step" on the bottom right is pressed, the Toolbus Viewer will execute only the next codeline from the Toolbus script. A single line will be highlighted in the script view to notify the user what line has been executed.<br>
