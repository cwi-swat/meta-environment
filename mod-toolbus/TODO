- Please see doc/paper_mod_toolbus.{tex|dvi|ps|pfd} as well.
- Apache provides 'libapreq' for manipulating (parts of) HTTP requests. They pretty much deprecate my read_HTTP_GET_arg() but it was left in for good measure.
- Remove all Apache 1.3 code and update to the new Apache 2.0 APR-API
- Make certain options user-configurable, like the ToolBus options for host, port, etc.
- investigate thread-safety issues (function calls, global variables, calls across module boundaries, Toolbus/ATerm functions
