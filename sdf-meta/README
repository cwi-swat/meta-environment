SDF META
--------

This package will contain the SDF layer around the kernel
Meta-Environment.  It should provide an SDF programming environment,
as well as the base implementation for other SDF-based languages
(like ASF+SDF).

This package will incrementally grow as more components are moved from
the following packages to this one, possibly originating from:
	- meta (toolbus scripts, sdf specific components)
	- sdf-support (import graph builder, sdf-modules, etc)

This package should not only provide the environment, but also the
commandline tools for dealing with *modular* SDF.
