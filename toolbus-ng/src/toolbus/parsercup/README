Generating the scanner/parser for ToolBus scripts.

Scanner
-------

There is a commandline method but that does not seem to work so I use:

java -jar JFlex.jar

This starts an interactive screen:
- In the "Lexical specification" toolbus.jflex
- Push the "Generate" button.

The result are two files: Lexer.java and sym.java

Parser
------

Run on the commandline:

java -jar java-cup-11a.jar -expect 1 -nopositions toolbus.cup

This generates the file parser.java that contains the actual parser.

Don't forget to refresh the files in the Eclipse navigator
when you include these generated files while developing
in Eclipse!

Switching between old and new parser
-----------------------------------

The ToolBus class has now two parse methods:
- parse (the old parser)
- parsecup (the CUP generated parser).


Rough edges
-----------

No attention has been paid yet to
- filenames and position information in error messages
- error recovery.
