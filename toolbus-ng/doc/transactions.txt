Basic idea
==========

Each process has a predefined variable Tid : transaction
with value of the form transaction(<int>).
(In reality I use the longer name TransactionId)

We extend eval, event, snd-msg and rec-msg with an extra argument that
represents the transaction.

We introduce the following patterns
( { ... } is an arbitrary process expression that may again contain
these patterns;  => gives translation):

eval trm { ... } value V?	
     => eval trm Tid { ... } value V? Tid

event trm { ... } ack V
      => let Tid : transaction in event trm Tid? { ... } ack V Tid endlet

snd-msg trm { ... } rec-msg trm'
	=> snd-msg trm Tid { ... } rec-msg trm' Tid

rec-msg trm { ... } snd-msg trm' => 
	rec-msg trm Tid? { ... } snd-msg trm' Tid

The idea is that the actions that are initiated "elsewhere" (event,
rec-msg) import the transaction id of their caller.

Issues:
- This solves the problem of finding the right value with the
  corresponding eval.
- Ditto for event and ack-event.
- snd-msg/rec-msg pairs are simply related by the same transaction id.

However, not all scripts fit this pattern as Pieter's example shows
(note that ack-events are not shown):

rec-event login(Name?, Password?) .
snd-msg login-attempt(Name, Password) .
( rec-msg login-succeeded .
  snd-ack-event status(true, "")
  LOGGED-IN
+
  rec-msg login-failed(Reason?) .
  snd-ack-event status(false, Reason)
)

Several solutions for this problem are possible:

process CLIENT is
...
(
  rec-event login(Name?, Password?) {
    snd-msg login-attempt(Name, Password) {
    } rec-msg login-succeeded . LOGGED-IN
    >>
    rec-msg login-failed .
  } ack-event
) * delta
 >>
rec-disconnect

The above solution is concise but has as disadvantage that
the login event is only acknowledged after completion of LOGGED-IN.
(This feels strange  but is it wrong?)

Another solution for using a state variable and disrupt:

process CLIENT is
...
(
  Success := true
  rec-event login(Name?, Password?) {
    snd-msg login-attempt(Name, Password) {
    } rec-msg login-succeeded
    >>
    rec-msg login-failed .
    Success := false
  } ack-event Success .
  if (Success) then
    LOGGED-IN
  fi
) * delta
 >>
rec-disconnect

It seems that we need more expressiveness. Attempt (allowing
alternatives for the rec-msg instead of a single rec-msg):

 rec-event login(Name?, Password?) {
    snd-msg login-attempt(Name, Password) {
    } ( rec-msg login-succeeded + Succes := true
      +
        rec-msg login-failed . Success := false
      )
  } ack-event Success .
  if (Success) then
    LOGGED-IN
  fi
) * delta
 >>
rec-disconnect

Issues:

- May be we need an enumeration type. The event above could get the
  type login : Name # PassWord -> [login-succeede,login-failed]

- This might also help for cases where we don't have a general button(<str>),
  but only need button(calc), button(quit), etc.
