	* libmept: libmept/MEPT-flatten.c: small bug in conversion of
	symbols.

Wed Jun 24 10:27:46 CEST 2009 <storm@cwi.nl>
	* libmept: libmept/MEPT-flatten.c: the flattener still had some
	dependencies on built-in layout; the special Rascal Layout symbol
	is now converted to the normal layout symbol.
	
	* libmept: libmept/MEPT-flatten.c: separated Rascal lists were not
	flattened correctly because the normalizer seems to handle Rascal
	Literal[["..."]]s differently from ordinary literals; this now
	fixed.
	
Thu Jun  4 17:46:46 CEST 2009 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * libmept: libmept/MEPT-flatten.c: matching of list patterns now
   ignores which kind of layout symbol is distributed between the
   non-terminals. 

Mon Jun  9 13:19:26 CEST 2008 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * pt-support.pc.in: Bumped version to 2.3

Wed Apr 16 11:02:29 CEST 2008 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * libmept/*: regenerated API with cast functions that fix
   type punned aliasing issues.
 * libmept/*: removed many direct casts and replaced them by toTerm, fromTerm
   macro calls.
 * libmept/MEPT-posinfo.c: commented out 'volatile' attribute that used to fix
   a type punned aliasing issue. 

Wed Apr 9 16:33  2008 CET  Tijs van der Storm  <tvdstorm@wlan1-52.cwi.nl>
 * libmept/MEPT-implode.c: Implode now detects NatCons and StrCons
   and implodes them to equivalent ATerms.

Thu Mar 27 10:18:36 EDT 2008 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * libmept/MEPT.adt: changed field name of term attributes to productions
   to "value", such that generating a Java API from MEPT.adt produces
   Java code that compiles. This fixes bug #839.

Mon Jan  7 14:13:32 CET 2008 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * libmept/MEPT-ordering.c: ATerror if a cyclic node is encountered.

Sat Dec  1 10:37:17 EST 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * libmept/*.c: removed usage of Location.h and LOC_ functions. Two
   versions of Location was to confusing. You forget to initialize
   the API's for example.

Wed Sep 12 11:30:49 CEST 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * utils/comparePT-main.c: removed the -a option from the usage information.
 * test/mept-test.c: removed the modAmbiguityOrdering parameter passed to
   PT_compareTrees, and added PT_orderAmbiguities where needed.

Wed Sep 12 08:41:23 CEST 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * libmept/MEPT-ordering.c: added tree cache to make the tool scalable.

Mon Sep 10 15:42:26 CEST 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * libmept/MEPT-ordering.[ch],utils/orderPT-main.c: added a tool that 
   normalizes the ordering of alternatives in all ambiguity clusters to
   a canonical ordering.:

Wed May 30 11:23:43 CEST 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * libptmept/lift.c: to prevent memory leaks, the user of the lift function
   has to provide her own ATermTable for memoization.

Tue Apr 17 16:47:20 CEST 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * libmept/MEPT-flatten.c: major bug in flattener solved. This makes
   the trunk quite unstable. There may be unforseen side-effects of this
   fix. Flattening of lexical lists did not happen at all if the list
   was separated. Obviously, seperated lexical lists are not often used,
   which is why the bug was not detected earlier. Two fixes have been
   done in the flattener: 
     1. patterns which had no-attrs in the production have been added
     a <term> hole, such that flattening also works on hidden productions.
     2. patterns for separated lexical lists have been added.
   All this was triggered by a bug report from Albert Hofkamp on the
   meta-users-list. The bug is solved by the above fixes.

Thu Mar 15 15:13:08 CET 2007 <{economop,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * lib*: regenerated libraries

Wed Mar 14 15:09:19 CET 2007 <{economop,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * Merged using-sglr-refactored branch into trunk.

Fri Mar  9 14:53:37 CET 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Merged revisions 21405-21789 via svnmerge from 
   svn+ssh://svn.cwi.nl/pt-support/trunk

Thu Mar  8 19:03:58 CET 2007 <{economop,kooiker,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
 * **: regenerated all API's in this package with a new version of 
   ApiGen that generates more efficient code for the is-alternative 
   predicates.

Fri Mar  2 10:36:46 CET 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Merged r21027-21406 via svnmerge from 
   svn+ssh://economop@svn.cwi.nl/pt-support/trunk
 * libmept/MEPT.{c,h}: regenerated api to use optimisation macros.
 * libmept/Makefile.am: added -DFAST_API to CPPFLAGS, but I think it's only
   needed in the tool that will use the api.

Tue Feb 20 15:35:09 CET 2007 <{martin.bravenboer@gmail.com,jurgenv@cwi.nl}>
 * libmept/MEPT-posinfo.c: added a magic volatile to solve a serious bug
   with the ATerm garbage collector on Darwin. 

Tue Feb 20 08:33:12 CET 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * libmept/MEPT.c: regenerated code using optimized apigen.

Mon Feb 19 23:13:23 CET 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * utils/filterPT: added filterPT tool by copying it from the 1.5 branch.
   Had to regenerate the tests, since the parse tree format had changed
   since then. Something rather peculiar happened though, the parser
   generates less ambiguities for the same terms. However, the old filterPT
   filters the new terms the same as the new filterPT. So, the bug is not
   in filterPT and therefore I have regenerated the tests for filterPT with
   some confidence.
 * TODO: analyze why sglr from 1.5 produces different parse forests than
   the sglr from the trunk for the grammars in utils/filterPT/sdf

Tue Feb  6 10:02:46 CET 2007 <{economop,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
 * libmept/MEPT-productions.{c,h}: added function to determine if a production 
   is defined by the user, or generated by the normaliser. 

Wed Jan 24 16:24:36 CET 2007 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Merged r21017,21020,21025-21026 via svnmerge from 
   svn+ssh://economop@svn.cwi.nl/pt-support/trunk

Wed Jan 24 16:10:17 CET 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * libmept/MEPT-yield.c: fixed a bug in the yielder (unparser)
   with cycles. Cycles should not prevent the yielding of 
   non-cyclic alternatives in an ambiguity cluster.

Fri Sep 15 16:27:41 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * libmept/MEPT-productions.{c,h}: added functions to check if productions 
   are preferred, avoided, or rejected. They were in MEPT-utils.c, but got
   factored out during the merge from trunk (SGLR needs them).

Fri Sep 15 15:43:25 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Merged from trunk.
 * libmept/MEPT-args.c: added PT_removeArgsTree() and PT_indexOfTreeInArgs(), 
   which were in MEPT-utils.c before it was removed during the merge.

Thu Sep 14 18:47:14 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * reconf: modified for new build env.
 * libmept/Makefile.am: corrected error.

Thu Sep 14 15:56:06 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Manually incorporated the new build environment.

Fri Jul 21 00:49:31 CEST 2006 <martin.bravenboer@gmail.com>
 * test/Makefile.am:  replaced noinst_ with check_: these
   programs and libraries are used for testing, so they should not be
   build in a normal build (problem popped up when creating a dist
   directly from Subversion, which failed).

 * test/terms/Makefile.am: replaced noinst_ with check_: these
   programs and libraries are used for testing, so they should not be
   build in a normal build (problem popped up when creating a dist
   directly from Subversion, which failed).

 * test/terms/Makefile.am: indicate that terms_dict.h is
   constructed from terms.dict, otherwise make does not know how to
   build terms_dict.h if it wants to create the headers first.

Fri Jun 30 21:43:04 CEST 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * libmept/MEPT-utils.[ch]: reorganized this long file into a number
   of smaller files that each deal with a specific topic.
 * libmept/*.c: added much documentation.

Thu Jun 29 15:12:34 CEST 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * doc: removed doc directory and moved generation of Doxygen 
   documentation to toplevel. Will copy this design to all
   other C based packages.

Tue Jun 27 22:26:54 CEST 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * libmept/MEPT.[ch]: regenerated the API, with new doxygen markup
   automatically added in.

Tue Jun 27 15:55:04 CEST 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * doc: added generation of doxygen site in MAINTAINER_MODE
 * libmept/flattenPT.c: changed flattening of ambiguous star lists,
   before it would contain nested PLUS lists if they were children
   of an ambiguity node. Changed this to STAR lists for type consistency
   after flattening.

Thu Jun 22 17:51:42 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Created this Changelog file to make merge with trunk easier.
 * Moved queries on PT_Productions from |sglr/filters.c| to |MEPT-utils.c|.

Wed Jun 21 14:51:23 CEST 2006 <{jurgenv,economop}@cwi.nl>
 * libmept/MEPT-utils.[ch]: added PT_removeArgsTree and
   PT_indexOfTreeInArgs



Wed Jun 14 09:45:43 CEST 2006 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * libmept/reportAmbs.c:
   - fixed declaration after statement

Thu May 18 13:42:56 CEST 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * utils/implodePT/test/out/*.out: changed .out suffixes to .ref
   to prevent triggering a GNU make implicit rule (which copies
   <stem> to <stem>.out when <stem>.out is older than <stem>.
 * Bumped version to 2.1   

Thu Apr 20 05:48:54 CEST 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * libmept/apply.c: added a new API function for applying functions
   that returns a more complex non-terminal than just a sort.

Thu Apr 13 21:22:47 CEST 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * utils/ambtracker-main.c: ambtracker is now a ToolBus tool
 * utils/ambtracker-main.c: changed use of error display
 * libmept/reportAmbs.c: fixed several issues in report ambs.

Thu Apr  13 17:14:44 EDT 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * libmept/reportAmbs.c: fixed to use memoization, was exponential
   in number of ambiguities
 * libmept/MEPT-utils.c: findTreeParent, same thing, this also was
   an exponential algorithm. Which is why the structure editor would
   collapse when you clicked in an ambiguous term.

Thu Apr  6 17:14:44 EDT 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * libmept/reportAmbs.c: added stack overflow protection.
 * libmept/reportAmbs.c: fixed a major recursion bug in it too.

Tue Apr  4 20:20:20 CEST 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * libptmept/lower.c: fixed major error in lowering sequence symbols.
 * libmept.c/flatten.c: fixed bug in layout flattener. Existing layout
   was flattened to a list of lexical layout nodes, but non-existing layout
   was not flattened to an empty list of lexical layout nodes. This skewed
   representation then lead to matching problems in ASF.

Fri Mar 10 11:39:54 CET 2006 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * **/Makefile.am:
   - Maintainers use ATerm-dbg library

Mon Dec 19 09:15:14 CET 2005 <{kooiker,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
 * libptmept/lower.c: Fixed a nice bug, forgot an 'else' before an
   'if'.

Fri Dec 16 10:33:44 CET 2005 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * utils/apply-function.idef:
   - return result of tree-equal with surrounding function application

Thu Nov 17 10:01:57 CET 2005 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * */*.c: Added AsFix representation for case insensitive literals

Thu Nov 10 12:52:01 CET 2005 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Generalized the definition of a cycle tree node. A cycle tree node 
   now has a type and a length. The length is the length of a cycle. The
   meaning of a cycle is an edge (reduction) that points back |length-1| 
   nodes upwards in the tree to construct a cycle.

Fri Aug 19 09:21:04 CEST 2005 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * MEPT.adt: changed field <character(int)> in CharRange to
             <start(int)>, to streamline coding with CharRanges.
 * character-classes.c: Added functionality in MEPT-utils.h to
   check whether a char-class symbol is a subset of another.

Mon Aug 15 15:08:29 CEST 2005 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * configure.in:
   - add libtool support

Tue Jun 14 09:01:00 CEST 2005 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * libmept/posInfo.c:
   - Change findTree to find a tree with an offset or a line-column pair

Fri Jun 10 15:27:05 CEST 2005 <M328@cwi.nl>
 * libmept/ordering.c:
   - Add parameters for ordering alternatives in ambiguity-clusters and ignoring     layout-trees while comparing
 * test:
   - Add tests for checking new options

Wed Jun  8 10:46:50 CEST 2005 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * NOTE: Having cycles in parse trees has some effects on how one can 
   interpret ambiguity clusters. Not all members of the cluster will
   yield the same string anymore. Principally they still do, because
   a cycle points back to the amb node, but in practise this means that
   you can't select a random amb node to compute the width of an
   ambiguity cluster anymore. You must pick one that is not a cycle to do
   this. 
 * libmept/posInfo.c: dealt with previous remark in implementation of 
   addPosInfo.

Wed Jun  8 10:21:52 CEST 2005 <M336@cwi.nl>
 * tests/test_mept.c: Added unit test for posInfo.

Mon May 30 13:26:37 CEST 2005 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * As an experiment, added the 'cycle' Tree constructor, it models an
   edge that goes back to the previous ambiguity cluster to form a cycle.

Wed Feb 23 11:18:18 CET 2005 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * libmept/flattenPT.c: fixed AsFix2 list patterns for lexical lists. They
   only worked with either lists of char-classes, or directly sort names,
   not more complex symbols.

Wed Feb  2 16:59:50 CET 2005 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * When renaming literals (the actual parameter, or the goal of the
   symbol renaming being a literal), we now have to construct a full literal
   tree.

Thu Jan 27 09:25:45 CET 2005 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Bumped to 2.0

Mon Dec 27 16:13:04 CET 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Having "structured lexicals" result in many changes:
	- flattening reimplemented; only lists are flattened. One routine
 	  implements flattening for all kinds of lists.
	- NB: literals are not flattened anymore, LAYOUT is not flattened
	  anymore either.
	- Changed flattening of functions that return lists. They are
	  treated as SUBLISTS; so, if the function is a sibling of other
   	  elements in the list they will both be child of a single list
 	  node. If the function is alone in a list, it will also be 
	  a child of a list node. No exceptions. The same holds for
	  list variables, but that was already the case before this change.
	- removed 'lit(Symbol)' from MEPT.adt, and regenerated the API
	- implemented PT_isTreeLit manually, and went by all calls to
	  PT_isTreeLit in the environment to check correctness of the code.
	- removed PT_isTreeFlatLexical function and related functions.
	- Fixed functions that deal with variable tree to also work
          with lexical variables
	- addPosinfo and reportAmbs simplified because literal trees 
	  dissappeared.
	- Deescaping functionality dissappeared.
	- PT_yieldAny fixed, the order of if-then-else excluded some cases.
	- Regenerated PTPT API's.
	- Reimplemented lifting and lowering of parse trees. Added
	  caching possibility between lifting and lowering of trees, 
	  because they are each others inverse operation.
	- Regenerated implodePT tests (after checking them manually),
	  they changed because the representation of a literal changed
          from lit(<>) to appl(prod([...],lit(<>),no-attrs),[...]).
	- TODO: check PT_makeTreeLit for completeness of escaping and
	  deescaping functionality.
	- TODO: check symbol-renaming.c because literals dissappeared!
	

Wed Sep  8 16:50:12 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Redefined Attrs in MEPT.adt using the list() construction instead
   of the manual single and many patterns.

Fri Aug 27 13:58:33 CEST 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * configure.in:
   - version 1.3
 * libmept, utils:
   - refactored and implemented unparseToString and unparseToFile

Thu Aug 19 11:01:07 CEST 2004 <{jong,markvdb}@cwi.nl>
 * libmept: regenerated MEPT API to reflect removal of "flat layout"
 * libmept/yieldPT.c: remove call to non-existant PT_isTreeFlatLayout

Thu Jul  8 09:35:01 CEST 2004 <{jurgenv,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * libmept/posInfo.c: 
   - findTreeAtOffset does not go into ambiguity clusters because an arbitrary
     choice has te be made otherwise

Thu Jun 24 12:49:47 CEST 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * libmept/reportAmbs.c: add PT_findTopAmbiguity 

Sun Jun  6 09:20:48 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Changed flattening of variables. The old flattened variables were 
   inconsistent, the number of arguments of the resulting production did
   not correspond to the real tree arguments. This made compiled
   specifications crash when trying to reconstuct an AsFix term from a muASF
   term, because one of the assumptions of that algorithm is that the
   production indicates the number of arguments.

Tue May  4 09:16:04 CEST 2004 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * utils/Makefile.am: removed trailing backslash 

Fri Apr 23 10:46:40 CEST 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * utils/unparse.idef: unparsed text is a "str", not a "term" !

Mon Apr 19 11:08:21 CEST 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * origins: account for the fact that there is no origin
 * libmept/posInfo.c: PT_containsAreaOffset count start upto and including end

Fri Apr 16 15:40:14 CEST 2004 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * libmept/posInfo.c: PT_findTreeAtOffset checks child is not FlatLexical

Fri Apr 16 14:09:54 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Reimplemented flattening of LAYOUT and lexicals. New algorithm generically
   collects all characters and puts them in a PT_Args. This reduces the
   amount of patterns to be recognized and fixes the bugs that depend on 
   missing patterns.

Wed Apr 14 13:00:50 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Fixed core dump for optional literals in implodePT

Fri Apr 16 13:43:14 CEST 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * libmept: add origin.c
 * libmept/origin.c: add PT_promotePosInfoToOrigin so we can have
   both origintracking and pos-info in the same term.
 * utils/ add calls to promote and get-origin

Wed Apr 14 13:00:25 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Fixed core dump for optional literals in implodePT

Mon Apr  5 10:52:55 CEST 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * assert valid parsetree in PT_addParseTreePosInfoToDepth

Wed Mar 24 10:31:40 CET 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * libmept/{posInfo,MEPT-utils}.c:
   - add PT_findArgsWithLocation
   - move PT_findTreeParent from posInfo to MEPT-utils
 * utils/addPosInfo: use Location API instead of Error API

Tue Mar 23 09:37:57 CET 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * libmept:
   - remove flat-layout from MEPT.adt, regenerated
   - add PT_findTreeAtOffset
 * libptmept: remove list reverse functions that are now generated

Mon Mar 22 13:12:24 CET 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * libmept/MEPT.adt: "upgrade-adt"'ed and API regenerated
 * *.[ch]: updated wrt new API

Fri Mar 19 08:34:16 CET 2004 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * libptmept:
   - API regenerated
   - lift.c/lower.c: no need to use handwritten _bottom functions anymore
   - PTMEPT_bottom.c removed
 * libptmept/PTMEPT_bottom.c removed

Fri Mar 12 17:13:32 CET 2004 <markvdb@cwi.nl>
 * Fixed bug 197, ambtracker returned NULL if there are
   no ambiguities.

Wed Mar 10 09:06:33 CET 2004 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * Use new error-api 

Mon Mar  8 14:20:01 CET 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * regenerated using APIgen that generates 'const char *'
 * removed legacy calls to "makeXXXToTerm" and "makeTermToXXX"

Tue Feb 10 15:27:49 CET 2004 <m336@cwi.nl>
 * upgrade auto* to: autoconf 2.59, automake 1.7.9, libtool 1.5.2

Tue Feb 10 09:26:08 CET 2004 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * MEPT-utils.c: corrected nested foldings hiding some functions
 * Makefile.am: removed merged cvs update markers 

Mon Feb  9 17:43:31 CET 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Using const char* in all ToolBus communication

Mon Feb  2 16:43:59 CET 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * fix Makefile.am to get "distcheck" working

2004/01/20 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Introduced the error api in the ambiguity tracker.

2004/01/13 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Set version to 1.1 

2004/01/12 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Prepared for the offset calculation.

2004/01/09 ({markvdb,jurgenv}@cwi.nl)
 * Changed addPosInfo to use the locations from error-support. So the
   annotations in parse trees are not longer
   area(<str>,<int>,<int>,<int>,<int>)!
 * Added dependency on error-support package

2003/11/21 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Merged libasfix2 and libconversion, then removed library libconversions
   and put all functionality into libmept/flattenPT.c. Added flattenTree
   to MEPT-utils.h and removed all dead interface code from the rest of 
   the conversion library.
 * apply function changed such that a function with no arguments is
   produced with the empty brackets.

2003/11/03 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added lowering, the opposite of lifting to ptmept. The liftPT tool supports
   it via the -l flag. Lowering of parsed ATerms and parsed AsFix is supported.

2003/10/09 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * By accident the strategy symbol was removed, added again.

2003/10/09 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added comparePT tool. Compares two parse trees modulo layout 
   and returns -1, 0 or 1

2003/10/09 ({jurgenv,markvdb}@cwi.nl)
 * Regenerated AsFix.def from library and synchronized.

2003/10/08 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Bumped into version 1.0.

2003/10/07 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Replaced [Symbol, pair, pair(<lhs(Symbol)>,<rhs(Symbol)>)]
   by [Symbol, tuple, tuple(<head(Symbol)>,<rest(Symbols)>)]

2003/10/03 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Removed perm, set, strategy symbol.

2003/09/25 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Added a function to check for constructor attributes.

2003/09/25 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added PT_compareTree a lexicographical ordering on parse trees.
   It ignores layout and annotations, is complete and stable (if the
   parse tree format remains stable). Only trees of the same non-terminal
   can be compared.
 * Added tests for libmept
 * Test terms are put in an automatically generated dictionary. All
   files ending in .pt in the test/terms directory are automagically
   added to this dictionary

 * Added #ifndef WITHOUT_TOOLBUS in order to rule out ToolBus code, in
   unparsePT-main.c

2001/09/27 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Made some important changes to the AsFix format. These changes are
   necessary to support some changes in the SDF syntax, and to fix some
   irregularities. The main benefit is the ability to have arbitrary ATerm
   attributes to productions. Other changes were made to have a slightly better
   correspondence between the SDF formalism and AsFix.
 * The following changes were made in the attributes of productions:
     - the constructors: "traverse", "memo" and "constructor" were removed.
     - the constructor: "assoc(x)" was added in order to comply
       with changes in the SDF grammar and its cons annotations. Only "left",
       "right", "assoc" and "non-assoc" can be children of assoc(x).
       Note that assoc(x) replaces the old atr(x) constructor.
     - the constructor: "term(term)" was added. The 'term' type corresponds to
       any ATerm.
     - the "atr(x)" constructor was removed around "bracket", "prefer", 
       "avoid" and "reject" in order to comply with the cons annotations of
       the SDF grammar.
 * See ChangeLog of sdf-support for the details on changes in SDF.
 * NOTE: these changes affect any tool using pt-support. The new version of
   pt-support will not be backward compatible with older versions. Therefor,
   any tool based on this package will also not be backward compatible.
