   specification.

    a symbol and shows the difference between variable and normal symbols.

2001/11/14 (jong@cwi.nl)
 * Fixed several bugs in argumenthandling in apply-function

   (It still suggested users pass a "-m <module>" both in usage() and
   in parameter checking. :(

 * Improved the functionality of implodePT. 
 * alternatives and sequences have still to be done.

2001/10/23 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Added #ifndef WITHOUT_TOOLBUS in order to rule out ToolBus code, in
   unparsePT-main.c

2001/09/27 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Made some important changes to the AsFix format. These changes are
   necessary to support some changes in the SDF syntax, and to fix some
   irregularities. The main benefit is the ability to have arbitrary ATerm
   attributes to productions. Other changes were made to have a slightly better
   correspondence between the SDF formalism and AsFix.
 * The following changes were made in the attributes of productions:
     - the constructors: "traverse", "memo" and "constructor" were removed.
     - the constructor: "assoc(x)" was added in order to comply
       with changes in the SDF grammar and its cons annotations. Only "left",
       "right", "assoc" and "non-assoc" can be children of assoc(x).
       Note that assoc(x) replaces the old atr(x) constructor.
     - the constructor: "term(term)" was added. The 'term' type corresponds to
       any ATerm.
     - the "atr(x)" constructor was removed around "bracket", "prefer", 
       "avoid" and "reject" in order to comply with the cons annotations of
       the SDF grammar.
 * See ChangeLog of sdf-support for the details on changes in SDF.
 * NOTE: these changes affect any tool using pt-support. The new version of
   pt-support will not be backward compatible with older versions. Therefor,
   any tool based on this package will also not be backward compatible.
