Wed Sep  8 16:50:12 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Redefined Attrs in MEPT.adt using the list() construction instead
   of the manual single and many patterns.

Fri Aug 27 13:58:33 CEST 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * configure.in:
   - version 1.3
 * libmept, utils:
   - refactored and implemented unparseToString and unparseToFile

Thu Aug 19 11:01:07 CEST 2004 <{jong,markvdb}@cwi.nl>
 * libmept: regenerated MEPT API to reflect removal of "flat layout"
 * libmept/yieldPT.c: remove call to non-existant PT_isTreeFlatLayout

Thu Jul  8 09:35:01 CEST 2004 <{jurgenv,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * libmept/posInfo.c: 
   - findTreeAtOffset does not go into ambiguity clusters because an arbitrary
     choice has te be made otherwise

Thu Jun 24 12:49:47 CEST 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * libmept/reportAmbs.c: add PT_findTopAmbiguity 

Sun Jun  6 09:20:48 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Changed flattening of variables. The old flattened variables were 
   inconsistent, the number of arguments of the resulting production did
   not correspond to the real tree arguments. This made compiled
   specifications crash when trying to reconstuct an AsFix term from a muASF
   term, because one of the assumptions of that algorithm is that the
   production indicates the number of arguments.

Tue May  4 09:16:04 CEST 2004 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * utils/Makefile.am: removed trailing backslash 

Fri Apr 23 10:46:40 CEST 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * utils/unparse.idef: unparsed text is a "str", not a "term" !

Mon Apr 19 11:08:21 CEST 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * origins: account for the fact that there is no origin
 * libmept/posInfo.c: PT_containsAreaOffset count start upto and including end

Fri Apr 16 15:40:14 CEST 2004 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * libmept/posInfo.c: PT_findTreeAtOffset checks child is not FlatLexical

Fri Apr 16 14:09:54 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Reimplemented flattening of LAYOUT and lexicals. New algorithm generically
   collects all characters and puts them in a PT_Args. This reduces the
   amount of patterns to be recognized and fixes the bugs that depend on 
   missing patterns.

Wed Apr 14 13:00:50 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Fixed core dump for optional literals in implodePT

Fri Apr 16 13:43:14 CEST 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>

   both origintracking and pos-info in the same term.

 * assert valid parsetree in PT_addParseTreePosInfoToDepth

Wed Mar 24 10:31:40 CET 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * libmept/{posInfo,MEPT-utils}.c:
   - add PT_findArgsWithLocation
   - move PT_findTreeParent from posInfo to MEPT-utils
 * utils/addPosInfo: use Location API instead of Error API

Tue Mar 23 09:37:57 CET 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * libmept:
   - remove flat-layout from MEPT.adt, regenerated
   - add PT_findTreeAtOffset

 * libmept/MEPT.adt: "upgrade-adt"'ed and API regenerated
 * *.[ch]: updated wrt new API

Fri Mar 19 08:34:16 CET 2004 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * libptmept:
   - API regenerated
   - lift.c/lower.c: no need to use handwritten _bottom functions anymore
   - PTMEPT_bottom.c removed
 * libptmept/PTMEPT_bottom.c removed

Fri Mar 12 17:13:32 CET 2004 <markvdb@cwi.nl>
 * Fixed bug 197, ambtracker returned NULL if there are
   no ambiguities.

Wed Mar 10 09:06:33 CET 2004 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * Use new error-api 

Mon Mar  8 14:20:01 CET 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * regenerated using APIgen that generates 'const char *'
 * removed legacy calls to "makeXXXToTerm" and "makeTermToXXX"

Tue Feb 10 15:27:49 CET 2004 <m336@cwi.nl>
 * upgrade auto* to: autoconf 2.59, automake 1.7.9, libtool 1.5.2

Tue Feb 10 09:26:08 CET 2004 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * MEPT-utils.c: corrected nested foldings hiding some functions
 * Makefile.am: removed merged cvs update markers 

Mon Feb  9 17:43:31 CET 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Using const char* in all ToolBus communication

Mon Feb  2 16:43:59 CET 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>

 * Prepared for the offset calculation.

2004/01/09 ({markvdb,jurgenv}@cwi.nl)
 * Changed addPosInfo to use the locations from error-support. So the
   annotations in parse trees are not longer
   area(<str>,<int>,<int>,<int>,<int>)!

 * apply function changed such that a function with no arguments is
   produced with the empty brackets.

2003/11/03 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added lowering, the opposite of lifting to ptmept. The liftPT tool supports
   it via the -l flag. Lowering of parsed ATerms and parsed AsFix is supported.

2003/10/09 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * By accident the strategy symbol was removed, added again.

2003/10/09 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)

2003/09/25 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added PT_compareTree a lexicographical ordering on parse trees.
   It ignores layout and annotations, is complete and stable (if the
   parse tree format remains stable). Only trees of the same non-terminal
   can be compared.
 * Added tests for libmept
 * Test terms are put in an automatically generated dictionary. All
   files ending in .pt in the test/terms directory are automagically
   added to this dictionary

2003/05/26 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * idefs spawn there own processes now

2003/05/16 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * yieldSymbol prints <S-VAR> and <S-LEX> for variable and lexical
   sorts now. Context-free sorts are still printed without the < -CF>.

2003/05/15 ({jurgenv,markvdb}@cwi.nl)

   variable is ambiguous we don't flatten and return the AsFix2 tree

   in the AsFix2 format.

 * Added support for annotations on PT_Trees and all kinds of ATerms 
   for PTPT_explode functionality. This means that every ATerm annotations
   is lifted to a parsed version too and is coupled with a PT_Tree using 
   the production  Tree Ann -> Tree. Similar for an annotated ATerm, see the
   ATerms syntax.
  
2002/01/09 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)

   in a parse tree.

2002/09/26 (vinju@loria.fr)

   Juergen Stuber. Replaced PT_appendArgs by PT_insertArgs
   followed by a PT_reverseArgs.
   
2002/01/22 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added support for ambiguities in addPosInfo
 * Bumped version of addPosInfo to 1.1
 * Added -P option to implodePT. If a layout tree is annotated
   with the ATerm attribute "layout-place-holder" it is replaced
   by "layout(layout-place-holder)" instead of "layout([<str>])".
   This is for the conservative pretty-printing facility of gpp.
 * Bumped version of implodePT to 1.1

2001/12/19 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)

  * Fixed a bug when dealing with ambiguities in lists.

2001/10/23 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Added #ifndef WITHOUT_TOOLBUS in order to rule out ToolBus code, in
   unparsePT-main.c

2001/09/27 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Made some important changes to the AsFix format. These changes are
   necessary to support some changes in the SDF syntax, and to fix some
   irregularities. The main benefit is the ability to have arbitrary ATerm
   attributes to productions. Other changes were made to have a slightly better
   correspondence between the SDF formalism and AsFix.
 * The following changes were made in the attributes of productions:
     - the constructors: "traverse", "memo" and "constructor" were removed.
     - the constructor: "assoc(x)" was added in order to comply
       with changes in the SDF grammar and its cons annotations. Only "left",
       "right", "assoc" and "non-assoc" can be children of assoc(x).
       Note that assoc(x) replaces the old atr(x) constructor.
     - the constructor: "term(term)" was added. The 'term' type corresponds to
       any ATerm.
     - the "atr(x)" constructor was removed around "bracket", "prefer", 
       "avoid" and "reject" in order to comply with the cons annotations of
       the SDF grammar.
 * See ChangeLog of sdf-support for the details on changes in SDF.
 * NOTE: these changes affect any tool using pt-support. The new version of
   pt-support will not be backward compatible with older versions. Therefor,
   any tool based on this package will also not be backward compatible.
