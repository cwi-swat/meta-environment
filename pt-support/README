Conversion Notes by Mark van den Brand (07-02-2001).

This pt-support directory contains 4 different "AsFix" sublibraries:
- asfix-old
- asfix1
- asfix2
- mept

The library asfix-old contains all old AsFix functionality.

The library asfix1 contains all AsFix functionality based on "api-gen"
for AsFix1.

The library asfix2 contains all AsFix functionality partly based on
"api-gen" for plain AsFix2 and partly hand-coded. By plain AsFix2
is meant the AsFix2 as described in the PhD thesis of Eelco Visser.

The library mept contains all AsFix functionality partly based on
"api-gen" for AsFix2ME and partly hand-coded. By AsFix2ME is meant
the "imploded" AsFix2 which will be the common format for all
Meta-Environment components.

The actual conversion from "old" AsFix to AsFix2ME will take place
in several major steps. 
In the first step the components: module-db, structure editor and 
evaluator are rewritten such that the use only functionality provided
by asfix1.
If this is completed, step 2 can be realised: SGLR produced terms
in AsFix2ME instead of AsFix1 and a filter from AsFix2ME-to-AsFix1
is inserted in front of the ASF+SDF compiler and parse-table
functionality (Add-Eqs-Syntax, Remove-Vars, pgen). The tools
module-db, structure editor and evaluator now work on AsFix2ME instead
of AsFix1.
In step 3 the compiler has to be adapted from "old" AsFix to AsFix2ME.
This means an adaptation of the specification as well as of the 
runtime environment.
In step 4 compiled specifications (Add-Eqs-Syntax and Remove-Vars) and
pgen have to be adapted.
In step 5 the libraries asfix-old and asfix1 can be removed.
