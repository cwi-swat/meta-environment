Parse Tree Support

Installation Instructions
=========================

1) Required packages.

   -GNU make, available from:
      www.gnu.org

   -The ATerm library, available from:
      www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/ 

2) Configuring Parse Tree Support.

   Assuming that the aterm library is installed in <aterm> and
   that Parse Tree Support should be installed in <pt-support> then 
   the following command will configure Parse Tree Support accordingly: 

    ./configure --prefix=<pt-support> --with-aterm=<aterm> 

   Note. Default behaviour of configure is that it will look for libraries               in <prefix>/lib and for executables in your search paths. So,                   you do not need to specify the locations of all these packages                  explicitly (as we did in the example above).

   If you use gcc, sglr is built with "gcc -Wall -g -O2". If you prefer
   different options use --with-cflags="<options>" when you run configure.

   ./configure --help gives a detailed list of configuration options.    

3) Building Parse Tree Support.

   Assuming that GNU make is called "gmake" on your system then the
   following commands will build and install Parse Tree Support:

   gmake
   gmake install

4) Checking Parse Tree Support.

   Parse Tree Support can be tested via:

   gmake check
