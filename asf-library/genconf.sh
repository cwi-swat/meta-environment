# This script generates a configure.in script from a package
# configuration file. The configuration file specifies the version of
# the GT distribution and which components are to be released and which
# are still under development.
#
# A package configuration file has the following structure:
#
#    version=<GT version number>
#    released=<list of released tools>
#    unreleased=<list of unreleased tools>
#
# genconf generates a configure.in file by substituting values for the
# variables __VERSION__, __RELEASED__, __UNRELEASED__, __TOOLS__, and
# __MAKEFILES__  from the file configure.in.src:
#
#    __VERSION__    is replaced by the value of the "version" parameter
#    __RELEASED__   is replaced by the value of the "released" parameter
#    __UNRELEASED__ is replaced by the value of the "unreleased" parameter
#    __TOOLS__      concatenation of the values of the "released" and
#                   "unreleased" parameters.
#    __MAKEFILES__  For each tool t in __TOOLS__ the __MAKEFILES__
#                   variables contains the entries src/t/Makefile and
#                   src/t/data/Makefile
#
# usage:
#   genconf [-d] [-h] <config_file>
#
# where
#   -d           Not only build released tools but tools under
#                development as well.
#   -h           Display this usage
#   config_file  name of configuration file
#
# The output of genconf is written to the file ./configure.in
