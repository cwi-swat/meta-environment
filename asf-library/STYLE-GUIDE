To ensure maximal reusability of ASF+SDF modules, it is useful to
abide by a number of guidelines.

Modular structure
-----------------

* hidden import of Layout
    The layout to be used in the equations should be imported in hidden
    fashion. This prevents conflicts with the layout of the user of
    the library.

* all variables should be hidden.

* all module names should be relative to the root of the library

Formatting
----------

* sort names should be in CamelCase: BoolCon
* module names should be with dashes: Pico-Booleans
* constructor names should be lowercase with dashes: cons("add-op")
* variables should look like:
    "Boolean"[0-9\']* -> Boolean
    "Boolean*"[0-9\']* -> Boolean*
    "Boolean,*"[0-9\']* -> {Boolean ","}*

Files
-----

* all modules in the library should be saved as baf with parsetables
* all baf files and parsetables should be committed to the repository
  (this prevents a circular dependency between the library and the
   Meta Environment at configure time).

Miscelaneous
-----------

* constructor annotations
    The "constructor" annotation should be added to productions that
    represent constructors (as opposed to functions). This makes the
    module easier to understand, and it may be used by the ASF interpreter
    or compiler.
