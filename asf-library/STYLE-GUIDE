To ensure maximal reusability of ASF+SDF modules, it is useful to
abide by a number of guidelines.

Modular structure
-----------------

* hidden import of Layout
    The layout to be used in the equations should be imported in hidden
    fashion. This prevents conflicts with the layout of the user of
    the library.

* hidden variables

Formatting
----------

* sort names
     Sort names with all capitals are discouraged.

Miscelaneous
-----------

* constructor annotations
    The "constructor" annotation should be added to productions that
    represent constructors (as opposed to functions). This makes the
    module easier to understand, and it may be used by the ASF interpreter
    or compiler.
