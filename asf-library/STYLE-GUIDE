To ensure maximal reusability of ASF+SDF modules, it is useful to
abide by a number of guidelines.

* hidden import of Layout
    The layout to be used in the equations should be imported in hidden
    fashion. This prevents conflicts with the layout of the user of
    the library.

* hidden variables

* module name prefixes
    Module names in the library should be prefixed with "ASFLib_". This
    prevents name clashes with module names of the user of the library.
