 CONFIGURATION

 Set prefix to any appropriate value when installing, e.g.,

 > ./configure --prefix=/usr/local

 This will cause executables to be installed in /usr/local/bin,
 libraries in /usr/local/lib, include files in /usr/local/include.

 Note that you need to include prefix/bin in your PATH, if it is not
 already.

 For information on other configuration parameters, type:

 > ./configure --help

----------------------------------------------------------------------

 INSTALLATION

 For both kinds of configurations, make the compiler by

 > gmake
 > gmake install
