%% The definitions of functions that return lists 
%% (e.g. 'find-decls(Program) -> Decl*') are problematic. The left-hand
%% sides are always wrapped by a list production
%% (e.g. list(cf(iter-star(sort("Decl"))))). This is due to a CONSISTENT
%% and correct mapping from AsFix2 to AsFix2ME. However, these left-hand
%% side will only match with singleton lists that happen to contain just
%% an application of such a function.
%%
%% The solution is to remove the list wrapper, such that the function will
%% be reduced anywhere it occurs. Such as in: 'Decl*1, find-decls(P), Decl*2'
