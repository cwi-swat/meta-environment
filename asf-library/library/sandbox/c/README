I imported the C disambiguation and extraction tools developed by Mehmet 
Oktener as follows:

languages/c90/syntax		C90 grammar
languages/c90/disambiguate	Disambiguation tools
ctools/extract			Call graph and control-flow graph extraction
terms				Various test terms

Note that the there are several version of the disambiguation tools.
At this time languages/c90/disambiguate/disamb5.sdf seems to work.
