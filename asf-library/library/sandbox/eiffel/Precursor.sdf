Parent-Qualification? "Precursor" Actuals? -> Precursor
"{" Class-Name "}" -> Parent-Qualification




%% Note: The Precursor construct is not part of the standard Eiffel
%% syntax. It has been introduced in Object-Oriented Software
%% Construction, second edition, and a proposal for its standardization
%% has been submitted to NICE. ISE Eiffel and Halstenbach will most
%% likely support this construct in their next release.

%% Note: In Object-Oriented Software Construction, second edition, the
%% class name in Parent_qualification is enclosed between double braces:
%% {{Class_name}}. However the proposal submitted to NICE uses the syntax
%% specified above.
