	[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9\_]* -> Identifier




%% Note: Unfortunately, SmallEiffel is case-sensitive. (Surprisingly, it
%% is not case-sensitive for Reserved_words.)

%% Note: An identifier is valid if and only if it is not one of the
%% Reserved_words.

%% Note: TowerEiffel cannot handle contiguous underscores in feature
%% names and class names.
