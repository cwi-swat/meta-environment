	-> Null-Instruction


%% Note: This instruction has a purely syntactical role: making sure that
%% extra semicolons added by oversight to a Compound are harmless, as in

%% if c then ; i1;;; i2; else ;; end

%% TowerEiffel does not support extra semicolons other than
%% terminators. All other compilers work as expected. SmallEiffel emits a
%% warning when parsing extra semicolons.
