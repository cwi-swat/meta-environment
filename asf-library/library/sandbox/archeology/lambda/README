This directory contains an algebraic specification in ASF+SDF of the
lamda-calculus. The specification and use of the generated environment
is described in:
"Specification and generation of a lambda-calculus environment",
Arie van Deursen, CWI report CS-R92??

To start the generated environment, start "(new-gse)" in *this*
directory. Enter as file a thing like "Nat.lambda".
N.B.: Before hitting the "Expand" button, you (yes you) should first enter
a term editor over module Lambda called "Defs" (no .lambda). You can
use the meta-environment window for this (Edit-term).

Have fun.
