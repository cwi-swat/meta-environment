Tue Jan 23 11:26:49 CEST 2006 <{storm,economop}@cwi.nl>
 * library/languages/sdf2/normalization/Lifting.asf: fixed a
   bug concerning the lifting of `Sort`'s to syntax. Only one-character
   sort names were lifted correctly (due to a typo in the spec).

Mon Dec 18 14:56:49 CET 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * library/languages/asf/compiler/muasf2c/Locate-Constants.{asf,sdf}:
   changed the way constants are located, and which code is generated
   for located constants. Before, a constant expression was replaced
   by an inline lookup such as (constant? constant : expr), which has
   undefined semantics if a single constant occurs more than once in an 
   expression. The compiler now collects all constants in an expression,
   and checks just before the statement that contains the expression
   whether or not to initialize the constant: 
   if(!constant) { constant = expr; }.
   
   This change allows the compiler to search for more constants in more
   locations, such as in the FUNC_EXIT (rhs of an equation). Several
   specifications have shown 2 times more constants detected. Also, it
   now detects instances of parse_sort and parse_cc as constants,
   which could take up a significant amount of user time when many traversal
   functions are used that have variable in the first argument of 
   the traversal function on the left-hand side of an equation.
 * library/languages/asf/normalization/Lexicals.asf: fixed an asf warning.
   (strict variable was not used)

Mon Nov 13 10:29:37 CET 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * library/languages/sdf2/analysis: removed as the code is not used in the 
   trunk. It is implemented in the branch: enable-rn-analysis.

Wed Sep 13 16:18:17 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * library/languages/sdf2/normalization/Sdf2-Normalization.asf: removed comma.

Wed Sep 13 14:23:14 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Removed the analysis of right nullable and nullable rules from the 
   normaliser (the extra data will not be used in the trunk yet and the cost
   on performace is not known).   
 * library/languages/sdf2/analysis: created the svn:ignore props.

Thu Sep  7 17:13:51 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * Added the analysis of right nullable and nullable rules to the 
   normaliser.

Thu Sep  7 13:57:38 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * library/languages/sdf2/analysis: added |Makefile.am|.

Wed Sep  6 17:00:53 CEST 2006 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * library/languages/sdf2/analysis: added a new collection
   of modules for SDF2: analyses. Here we collect analyses of
   grammars and store the results in a Kernel module for later
   use by static checkers or the parsetable generator. 
   Added Nullable analysis and right-nullable analysis for the
   sake of RNGLR.

Wed May 31 14:57:04 CEST 2006 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * library/containers/Set.{sdf,asf}:
   - Fixed merge error

Wed Apr 19 20:51:40 CEST 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * library/languages/sdf2/normalization:
   There were serious errors in a number of locations:
     - regular expressions were not expanded from productions generated
       out of context-free priorities sections. This was because p[[.]]
       was applied after r[[.]].
     - the Character table was not complete enough, it still depended on 
       the old type-less implementations of characters to work correctly.
       Regenerated a fully complete table by enumerating all characters
       in the classes for ShortChar
     - fixed the lifting operator for (), the empty symbol.   
     - literal expansion was not syntax-safe, error were generated by the
       asf-checker.
 * Fixed a serious bug in the normalization of groups of productions with 
   selection of a particular argument for a priority.

Tue Feb 21 14:20:28 CET 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * library/asf/asfsdf-checker: moved source of asfsdf-checker here

Thu Dec 15 13:13:15 CET 2005 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * library/sandbox/archeology/clax/{old,origins}/aux.ll
   - renamed to auxiliary.ll because on Windows and thus Cygwin filenames are
     not allowed to be called aux.*, prn.*, con.* etc.

Tue Sep  6 11:49:36 CEST 2005 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * library/basic/Modules.sdf:
   - Extract dependencies from module

Tue Aug 23 13:11:02 CEST 2005 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * library/basic/{Bytes,Strings},{asf,sdf}:
	- removed circular dependency between Bytes and Strings. Strings
	  does not imports Bytes anymore, and Bytes imports StrCon instead
          of Strings.
	- added implementation of 'ctype' functions for classifying Bytes.
	- added implementation of to-upper and to-lower 

Fri Aug 19 15:15:10 CEST 2005 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * library/basic/Modules.sdf:
   - Describes the syntax of the modules used in the meta-env

Wed Jun  8 09:37:00 CEST 2005 <M336@cwi.nl>
 * library/basic/Areas.sdf:
   - Added comments describing the structure of an area

 * Improved the syntax of prefix functions.

Fri Mar 25 11:28:57 CET 2005 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Cleaned up C grammar:
    - Onely one expression sort left (by using priorities)
    - Choice of three topmodules: CWithComments, CAfterPreprocessor,
      or CWithPreprocessor
    - Copied Comments.sdf and Layout.sdf from cpp grammar. It's a clone,
      but I think these two grammars should be allowed to evolve 
      independently.

Thu Mar 10 13:40:29 CET 2005 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * library/languages/c/syntax/Generic-Preprocessor.sdf:

Tue Mar  1 11:56:06 CET 2005 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * utilities/Makefile.am: no install due to () iso {}

Tue Feb 22 16:48:01 CET 2005 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * languages/c/syntax/Simplified-C.sdf: Added a definition of C that 
   maximally uses priorities, optionals and lists. Priorities for
   specific arguments are exploited such that only one Expression sort
   remains. The priorities of operators is not guaranteed to be ANSI
   compliant. This needs to be investigated later.
 * languages/c/syntax/Simplified-C-Preprocessor.sdf: defines common
   usage of C preprocessor statements, as they are usually embedded 
   in a C program. No guarantee whatsoever, but it allows one to play
   with C programs that contain preprocessor directives.

Wed Feb  9 09:15:20 CET 2005 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * languages/asf/compiler: stored the fact that a builtin function has
   a side-effect attribute in the name of the function. Locate-Constants
   can then decide not to factor out a constant function application.
 * utilities/*.sdf: annotated all builtins with side-effects with the
   'side-effect' production attribute.

Thu Feb  3 10:00:57 CET 2005 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Added ATerm pretty printer

Tue Feb  1 17:52:09 CET 2005 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>

Wed Jan 26 10:13:00 CET 2005 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Added specifications: languages/asf/compiler and
   languages/asf/normalization. The compiler moved from the ASF package.
   The normalizer is a new tool.
 * TODO: reimplement muasf2tom.
 * Reimplemented Bytes, Strings, Integers with structured lexicals
 * CHANGED escaping notation for StrCon to decimal notation and 
   simplified the syntax.
 * Added cons attributes to lexical syntax where needed.
 * Several big changes in SDF specifications, explained in pgen package.
 * ASCII module fixed
 * Pico-syntax imports basic/NatCon and basic/StrCon instead of Strings
   and Integers such that the syntax does not import equations!

Mon Nov 15 12:47:00 CET 2004 <markvdb@cwi.nl>
 * Merged 1.5 and trunk.
	
Sat Nov 13 10:43:17 CET 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>

   necessary reductions for creating disambiguation rules. It removes
   double occurrences and removes the cluster when only one alternative
   is left.
 * Added utilities/Debug.{asf,sdf} that puts Tide and PosInfo together
   for convenience. 
 * Copied all pico demo stuff into library for convenience. Still need to
   figure out what to do with the meta.buttons file! 

Tue Nov  9 20:25:52 CET 2004 <markvdb@cwi.nl>
 * languages/sdf2/renaming: Fixed the manipulation of renamings in order 
   to solve bug #404.

Mon Oct 11 15:33:15 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl, sgmcorne@science.uva.nl>

Tue Feb 10 15:27:49 CET 2004 <m336@cwi.nl>
 * upgrade auto* to: autoconf 2.59, automake 1.7.9, libtool 1.5.2


Mon Feb  2 16:43:59 CET 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * fix Makefile.am to get "distcheck" working

2004/01/23 ({jurgenv,jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl)
  * separated out the syntax definitions of StrCon from Strings and
    NatCon from Integers. This allows other languages to use the syntax
    and non-terminals of the library without depending on the implementation
    of the functionality on Strings and NatCons.
  * Some SIGNIFICANT changes in the Box language intended to simplify
    apigeneration and separate syntax from semantics:
      - StrCon -> Box instead of String -> Box
        (now Box does not depend on the implementation of Strings anymore
        including the basic/Integers imported by the Strings module)
      - SpaceSymbol "=" NatCon  -> SOption
        (now Box does not depend on the implementation of Integers anymore,
        only on the basic NatCon lexical definition)
      - added cons attributes where necessary in the Box language.
      - removed operators like "++" and ":" from the Box syntax definition.
        I'm sorry if this broke some specifications, but they are very easy
        to reproduce in a new Box-Operations module.

Tue Jan 20 14:46:47 CET 2004 <{jong,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
 * basic/Locations.{asf,sdf}:

  * added write-bytes-to-file and read-bytes-from-file builtins
  * renamed unparse to unparse-to-bytes and added unparse-to-file


2003/11/10 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)

    conditions to solve the problem.
  * Solved several new warnings of the SDF checker in the normalizer too.

    in order to get in sync with Sdf.label.def in sdf-support.

2003/09/26 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Removed the Layout module from the aterm syntax.
  * Added \r to basic/Whitespace

2003/09/25 ({storm,jurgenv}@cwi.nl)
  * Reimplemented TermCompare module using better ordering builtin
  * Added Measure.sdf

2003/09/22 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Restructured the library:
      - basic (still contains basic data-types)
      - containers (still contains paramatrized data-structures)
      - utilities (contains access to ASF builtins and other practical stuff)
      - languages (contains specificiations of all kinds of languages)
  * Promoted cpp grammar from sandbox to languages
  * Changed module names of ATerm syntax to correspond better to the 
    style guide
  * Added lifting operators in utilities/Lifting (reflection)

2003/09/22 (storm@cwi.nl)

2003/09/16 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Extracted asf-library from the asf package. The ChangeLog in the
    asf package between 2003/07/06 and 2003/09/16 contains some relevant
    messages for this new package!
  * Set version number to 1.0

2003/07/06 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Removed all .baf and .tbl files because they are not loaded anymore
    by the Meta-Environment anyway. This saves a lot of space in the
    distribution.
  * Removed installation architecture for the above files too

2003/05/20 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Fixed bug in containers/Set module. It imported basic/Boolean in an
    hiddens section, but the 'elem' function exported a Boolean result.
    This leads inevitably to problems when a Boolean value from the
    elem function is matched against another Boolean value (due to the
    id(<modulename>) production attribute).

2003/04/15 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Added a number of very old specifications to the sandbox (unreleased
    specifications). Partially converted them to new ASF+SDF syntax.
    
2003/04/01 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Set no longer re-use the List module. 
  * Square brackets are replaced by curly brackets.

2002/10/12 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)

    Heterogeneous data-types and traversals not supported (yet).

2002/05/23 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Added experimental library for functional programming in ASF containing:
      id, const, curry, uncurry, sequence, flip, apply, map and fold[lr],
      zip, zipWith, tuple, fst, snd etc.
  * Added experimental library for traversal programming in ASF containing:
      topdown, bottomup, oncetd for type-preserving and type-unifying 
      traversals
  * Added setting and getting of annotations in terms.
  * Fixed some minor bugs in the built-in system.

2002/05/22 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Worked out built-in definition and compilation further. Built-in
    implementations are next to sdf files again where they are defined.
  * Added map function from List[[From]] to List[[To]]

2002/05/21 ({jurgenv,markvdb}@cwi.nl)
  * Made built-in compilation more sophisticated. 
    - Every subdirectory can declare a PACKAGE_SRC variable that tells in which 
      files the built-ins are implemented
    - Every declared built-in in a sdf file is tested to have an
      implementation in one of the declared PACKAGE_SRC files.
    - Every PACKAGE_SRC is registered in ${top}/src/objects.lst
    - Every built-in is registered in ${top}/src/builtins.lst
    - Using these files the library is finally collected and built.
      
2002/05/17 ({jurgenv,markvdb}@cwi.nl)
  * Added sdf2 syntax
  * Refactored sdf2 syntax
  * Moved ATerm syntax from sdf2 syntax to own toplevel library
  * Added read-term-from-file and write-term-to-file to system library

2002/05/15 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Baffiles and tables are also installed (after sdf files such that
    timestamps are correct.
  * Directories are made read-only after installation
  * Added saved baf and tables for all modules so far
  * Added builtin architecture (see STYLE-GUIDE)
  * Added part of ATerm level 1 interface

2002/05/14 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Added automatic installation of the library modules
  * Removed all dependencies on other packages for the moment
  * Set version to 0.2beta

2002/05/13 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Removed generation of configure script
  * Restarted asf library initiative using compound module names

2001/12/21 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Added --with-pt-support, --with-sglr and --with-asf configure options.
  * Fixed make_rules.asf to be able to handle distcheck target.

2001/08/30 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * improved the efficiency of the addition.

2001/07/31 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Set version to 0.1alfa

2001/07/25 (joost.visser@cwi.nl)
  * Started to create an ASF library.
  * Started a test framework for ASF specifications.
