2003/09/22 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Restructured the library:
      - basic (still contains basic data-types)
      - containers (still contains paramatrized data-structures)
      - utilities (contains access to ASF builtins and other practical stuff)
      - languages (contains specificiations of all kinds of languages)
  * Promoted cpp grammar from sandbox to languages
  * Changed module names of ATerm syntax to correspond better to the 
    style guide
  * Added lifting operators in utilities/Lifting (reflection)

2003/09/22 (storm@cwi.nl)
  * Added grammar for the C Preprocessor to the Sandbox.
  * Added tentative ASCII module to basic/.
  * Removed Hashtable, added Bounded Balanced Trees.
  * Added module for byte sequences to library: basic/Bytes.
    You can now convert strings with escape sequences to actual
    byte streams and back.
  * Fixed deprecated syntax in basic/Strings
  * Added str-len and str-cmp function to basic/Strings.

2003/09/17 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Removed remaining unnecessary chmod calls in install and uninstall 
    targets.
  * Added longest match on NatCon

2003/09/16 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Extracted asf-library from the asf package. The ChangeLog in the
    asf package between 2003/07/06 and 2003/09/16 contains some relevant
    messages for this new package!
  * Set version number to 1.0

2003/07/06 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Removed all .baf and .tbl files because they are not loaded anymore
    by the Meta-Environment anyway. This saves a lot of space in the
    distribution.
  * Removed installation architecture for the above files too

2003/05/20 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Fixed bug in containers/Set module. It imported basic/Boolean in an
    hiddens section, but the 'elem' function exported a Boolean result.
    This leads inevitably to problems when a Boolean value from the
    elem function is matched against another Boolean value (due to the
    id(<modulename>) production attribute).

2003/04/15 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Added a number of very old specifications to the sandbox (unreleased
    specifications). Partially converted them to new ASF+SDF syntax.
    
2003/04/01 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Set no longer re-use the List module. 
  * Square brackets are replaced by curly brackets.

2002/10/12 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Moved entire library to asf package. We will maintain this ChangeLog
    since the library is such an isolated subtree in the package.

2002/07/29 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Updated STYLE-GUIDE and README
  * Release 0.3

2002/07/25 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Removed libraries put back.
  * Bumped to version 0.3beta

2002/07/24 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Temporarily removed functions, strategies, containers, disambiguation
    and asf/tools from library in order to make a stable 0.2 release.
  * Release 0.2

2002/07/11 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Added sdf2 normalizer
  * Strategies now support full traversal and heterogeneous data-types.
    To use it, import the strategies/Operators for every non-terminal in
    the traversed grammar.
  * Added side-effect: Counter
  * Added side-effect: Normalization (to normalize terms that have been
    obtained by other side-effects)
  * Restructured library for ASF
  * Added basic library for disambiguation

2002/07/03 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Added asf/Variables. A module that defines variables for a specific sort.
  * Added the syntax of ASF

2002/07/01 (vandenbr@loria.fr)
  * Rolled back the modifications performed on 2002/06/14.

2002/06/14 (jong@cwi.nl,markvdb@cs.vu.nl)
  * Restructured the "Literal"s in ATerm syntax and Sdf syntax.
  * Added ATermOperations (in OO style).
  * Added ATerm placeholder.
  * Fixed ChangeLog dates.

2002/05/24 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Added Stratego-like programming language with simple interpreter. 
    Heterogeneous data-types and traversals not supported (yet).

2002/05/23 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Added experimental library for functional programming in ASF containing:
      id, const, curry, uncurry, sequence, flip, apply, map and fold[lr],
      zip, zipWith, tuple, fst, snd etc.
  * Added experimental library for traversal programming in ASF containing:
      topdown, bottomup, oncetd for type-preserving and type-unifying 
      traversals
  * Added setting and getting of annotations in terms.
  * Fixed some minor bugs in the built-in system.

2002/05/22 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Worked out built-in definition and compilation further. Built-in
    implementations are next to sdf files again where they are defined.
  * Added map function from List[[From]] to List[[To]]

2002/05/21 ({jurgenv,markvdb}@cwi.nl)
  * Made built-in compilation more sophisticated. 
    - Every subdirectory can declare a PACKAGE_SRC variable that tells in which 
      files the built-ins are implemented
    - Every declared built-in in a sdf file is tested to have an
      implementation in one of the declared PACKAGE_SRC files.
    - Every PACKAGE_SRC is registered in ${top}/src/objects.lst
    - Every built-in is registered in ${top}/src/builtins.lst
    - Using these files the library is finally collected and built.
      
2002/05/17 ({jurgenv,markvdb}@cwi.nl)
  * Added sdf2 syntax
  * Refactored sdf2 syntax
  * Moved ATerm syntax from sdf2 syntax to own toplevel library
  * Added read-term-from-file and write-term-to-file to system library

2002/05/15 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Baffiles and tables are also installed (after sdf files such that
    timestamps are correct.
  * Directories are made read-only after installation
  * Added saved baf and tables for all modules so far
  * Added builtin architecture (see STYLE-GUIDE)
  * Added part of ATerm level 1 interface

2002/05/14 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Added automatic installation of the library modules
  * Removed all dependencies on other packages for the moment
  * Set version to 0.2beta

2002/05/13 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)

  * Restarted asf library initiative using compound module names

2001/12/21 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Added --with-pt-support, --with-sglr and --with-asf configure options.
