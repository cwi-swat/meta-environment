 * library/asf/asfsdf-checker: moved source of asfsdf-checker here
 * library/sdf2/checker: moved source of sdf-checker here
 * library/sdf2/checker: fixed bug 464, add full support for renamings

Mon Feb 13 13:59:27 CET 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * library/**: Moved all syntax definitions to sdf-library!
 * package: set version to 2.0
 * package: added dependency on sdf-library package

Fri Dec 23 10:37:18 CET 2005 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * library/languages/sdf2/*: added case-insensitive literals to SDF2

Thu Dec 15 13:13:15 CET 2005 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * library/sandbox/archeology/clax/{old,origins}/aux.ll
   - renamed to auxiliary.ll because on Windows and thus Cygwin filenames are
     not allowed to be called aux.*, prn.*, con.* etc.

Tue Sep  6 11:49:36 CEST 2005 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * library/basic/Modules.sdf:
   - Extract dependencies from module

Fri Aug 19 15:15:10 CEST 2005 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * library/basic/Modules.sdf:
   - Describes the syntax of the modules used in the meta-env

Wed Jun  8 09:37:00 CEST 2005 <M336@cwi.nl>
 * library/basic/Areas.sdf:
   - Added comments describing the structure of an area

Tue Apr 12 17:05:18 CEST 2005 <markvdb@cwi.nl>
 * Improved the syntax of prefix functions.

Fri Mar 25 11:28:57 CET 2005 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Cleaned up C grammar:
    - Onely one expression sort left (by using priorities)
    - Choice of three topmodules: CWithComments, CAfterPreprocessor,
      or CWithPreprocessor
    - Copied Comments.sdf and Layout.sdf from cpp grammar. It's a clone,
      but I think these two grammars should be allowed to evolve 
      independently.

Thu Mar 10 13:40:29 CET 2005 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * library/languages/c/syntax/Generic-Preprocessor.sdf:
   - Filename start and ends with either < and > or ", but you cannot mix them
   - Split IncludeFile into SystemInclude and LocalInclude 

Thu Mar 10 10:52:39 CET 2005 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * library/languages/basic/Bytes.asf: fixed byte-to-strchar to output space rather
 than \032

Tue Mar  1 13:43:41 CET 2005 <markvdb@cwi.nl>
 * languages/sdf2/syntax/Literals.sdf: introduced the sort
   FunctionName with subsorts IdCon and StrCon.

Tue Mar  1 11:56:06 CET 2005 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * utilities/Makefile.am: no install due to () iso {}

Tue Feb 22 16:48:01 CET 2005 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * languages/c/syntax/Simplified-C.sdf: Added a definition of C that 
   maximally uses priorities, optionals and lists. Priorities for
   specific arguments are exploited such that only one Expression sort
   remains. The priorities of operators is not guaranteed to be ANSI
   compliant. This needs to be investigated later.
 * languages/c/syntax/Simplified-C-Preprocessor.sdf: defines common
   usage of C preprocessor statements, as they are usually embedded 
   in a C program. No guarantee whatsoever, but it allows one to play
   with C programs that contain preprocessor directives.

Wed Feb  9 09:15:20 CET 2005 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * languages/asf/compiler: stored the fact that a builtin function has
   a side-effect attribute in the name of the function. Locate-Constants
   can then decide not to factor out a constant function application.
 * utilities/*.sdf: annotated all builtins with side-effects with the
   'side-effect' production attribute.

 * CHANGED escaping notation for StrCon to decimal notation and 
   simplified the syntax.
 * Added cons attributes to lexical syntax where needed.
 * Several big changes in SDF specifications, explained in pgen package.
 * ASCII module fixed
 * Pico-syntax imports basic/NatCon and basic/StrCon instead of Strings
   and Integers such that the syntax does not import equations!

   double occurrences and removes the cluster when only one alternative
   is left.
 * Added utilities/Debug.{asf,sdf} that puts Tide and PosInfo together
   for convenience. 
 * Copied all pico demo stuff into library for convenience. Still need to
   figure out what to do with the meta.buttons file! 

Tue Nov  9 20:25:52 CET 2004 <markvdb@cwi.nl>
 * languages/sdf2/renaming: Fixed the manipulation of renamings in order 
   to solve bug #404.

Mon Feb  2 16:43:59 CET 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * fix Makefile.am to get "distcheck" working

2004/01/23 ({jurgenv,jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl)
  * separated out the syntax definitions of StrCon from Strings and
    NatCon from Integers. This allows other languages to use the syntax
    and non-terminals of the library without depending on the implementation
    of the functionality on Strings and NatCons.
  * Some SIGNIFICANT changes in the Box language intended to simplify
    apigeneration and separate syntax from semantics:
      - StrCon -> Box instead of String -> Box
        (now Box does not depend on the implementation of Strings anymore
        including the basic/Integers imported by the Strings module)
      - SpaceSymbol "=" NatCon  -> SOption
        (now Box does not depend on the implementation of Integers anymore,
        only on the basic NatCon lexical definition)
      - added cons attributes where necessary in the Box language.
      - removed operators like "++" and ":" from the Box syntax definition.
        I'm sorry if this broke some specifications, but they are very easy
        to reproduce in a new Box-Operations module.

Tue Jan 20 14:46:47 CET 2004 <{jong,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>

  * added write-bytes-to-file and read-bytes-from-file builtins
  * renamed unparse to unparse-to-bytes and added unparse-to-file


2003/11/10 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)

    conditions to solve the problem.
  * Solved several new warnings of the SDF checker in the normalizer too.

      - utilities (contains access to ASF builtins and other practical stuff)
      - languages (contains specificiations of all kinds of languages)
  * Promoted cpp grammar from sandbox to languages
  * Changed module names of ATerm syntax to correspond better to the 
    style guide

    messages for this new package!
  * Set version number to 1.0

2003/07/06 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Removed all .baf and .tbl files because they are not loaded anymore
    by the Meta-Environment anyway. This saves a lot of space in the
    distribution.
  * Removed installation architecture for the above files too

2003/05/20 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Fixed bug in containers/Set module. It imported basic/Boolean in an
    hiddens section, but the 'elem' function exported a Boolean result.
    This leads inevitably to problems when a Boolean value from the
    elem function is matched against another Boolean value (due to the
    id(<modulename>) production attribute).

2003/04/15 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Added a number of very old specifications to the sandbox (unreleased
    specifications). Partially converted them to new ASF+SDF syntax.
    
2003/04/01 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Set no longer re-use the List module. 
  * Square brackets are replaced by curly brackets.

2002/10/12 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)

      id, const, curry, uncurry, sequence, flip, apply, map and fold[lr],
      zip, zipWith, tuple, fst, snd etc.
  * Added experimental library for traversal programming in ASF containing:
      topdown, bottomup, oncetd for type-preserving and type-unifying 
      traversals
  * Added setting and getting of annotations in terms.
  * Fixed some minor bugs in the built-in system.

2002/05/22 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Worked out built-in definition and compilation further. Built-in
    implementations are next to sdf files again where they are defined.
  * Added map function from List[[From]] to List[[To]]

2002/05/21 ({jurgenv,markvdb}@cwi.nl)
  * Made built-in compilation more sophisticated. 
    - Every subdirectory can declare a PACKAGE_SRC variable that tells in which 
      files the built-ins are implemented
    - Every declared built-in in a sdf file is tested to have an
      implementation in one of the declared PACKAGE_SRC files.
    - Every PACKAGE_SRC is registered in ${top}/src/objects.lst
    - Every built-in is registered in ${top}/src/builtins.lst
    - Using these files the library is finally collected and built.
