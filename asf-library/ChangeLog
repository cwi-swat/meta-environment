2002/07/03 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Added asf/Variables. A module that defines variables for a specific sort.
  * Added the syntax of ASF

2002/07/01 (vandenbr@loria.fr)
  * Rolled back the modifications performed on 2002/06/14.

2002/06/14 (jong@cwi.nl,markvdb@cs.vu.nl)
  * Restructured the "Literal"s in ATerm syntax and Sdf syntax.
  * Added ATermOperations (in OO style).
  * Added ATerm placeholder.
  * Fixed ChangeLog dates.

2002/05/24 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Added Stratego-like programming language with simple interpreter. 
    Heterogeneous data-types and traversals not supported (yet).

2002/05/23 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Added experimental library for functional programming in ASF containing:
      id, const, curry, uncurry, sequence, flip, apply, map and fold[lr],
      zip, zipWith, tuple, fst, snd etc.
  * Added experimental library for traversal programming in ASF containing:
      topdown, bottomup, oncetd for type-preserving and type-unifying 
      traversals
  * Added setting and getting of annotations in terms.
  * Fixed some minor bugs in the built-in system.

2002/05/22 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Worked out built-in definition and compilation further. Built-in
    implementations are next to sdf files again where they are defined.
  * Added map function from List[[From]] to List[[To]]

2002/05/21 ({jurgenv,markvdb}@cwi.nl)
  * Made built-in compilation more sophisticated. 
    - Every subdirectory can declare a PACKAGE_SRC variable that tells in which 
      files the built-ins are implemented
    - Every declared built-in in a sdf file is tested to have an
      implementation in one of the declared PACKAGE_SRC files.
    - Every PACKAGE_SRC is registered in ${top}/src/objects.lst
    - Every built-in is registered in ${top}/src/builtins.lst
    - Using these files the library is finally collected and built.

  * Added sdf2 syntax
  * Refactored sdf2 syntax
  * Moved ATerm syntax from sdf2 syntax to own toplevel library
  * Added read-term-from-file and write-term-to-file to system library

  * Baffiles and tables are also installed (after sdf files such that
    timestamps are correct.
  * Directories are made read-only after installation
  * Added saved baf and tables for all modules so far
  * Added builtin architecture (see STYLE-GUIDE)
  * Added part of ATerm level 1 interface
