<H1>Components in the new Asf+Sdf Meta-Environment</H1>

The new Asf+Sdf Meta-Environment consists of the following components:
<UL>
<LI> <A HREF="#control-tool">A control tool</A>, which shows an overview
     of the module import graph and offers the basic user interface
     functionality to control the rest of the system.
     <LI> A <A HREF="#hybrid-editor">hybrid editor</A>,
          consisting of two subcomponents,
          the <EM>structured editor</EM> and the <EM>text editor</EM>.
          An editor instance of the hybrid editor can be used to edit the
          syntax of a module, the equations of a module, or a term over
          a specific module.
     <LI> A <A HREF="#parser">parser</A>, which can parse terms given a 
	  parse table and an input string.
     <LI> A <A HREF="#parser-generator">parser generator</A>,
          which can generate parse tables
          giving the complete syntax of a module and its submodules.
     <LI> A <A HREF="#evaluator">evaluator</A>,
          which can evaluate a term given an input term and a list 
         of equations.
     <LI> A <A HREF="#compiler">compiler</A>,
          which can compile a specification and
          generate C code for it.
     <LI> A <A HREF="#module-database">module
          database</A>,
          which keeps track of all modules
          and relations between modules in the system.
     <LI> A <A HREF="#term-database">term database</A>,
          which keeps track of all terms in the system, and acts as an
          <EM>AsFix term cache</EM>, caching the results of parsing terms.
     <LI> An <A HREF="#unparser">unparser</A>,
          which can unparse terms, either to text
          (by updating the layout in the AsFix representation of the term),
          TeX code, or HTML code, given a list consisting of pairs of
          syntax rules and box expressions.
     <LI> An <A HREF="#unparser-generator">unparse generator</A>, 
          which can generate lists consisting
          of pairs of syntax rules and box expressions.
</UL>

<P> The user interface of the Meta-Environment is based on two components:
<UL>
<LI> A syntax directed editor that can be used to edit both modules
and terms over the specified language(s).
These terms can be evaluated by interpreting the equations in the
specification as rewrite rules.
<LI> A central control tool
that gives an overview of the specifications at the module level.
This control tool allows the user to load and save specifications,
add and delete modules, typeset specifications in TeX or HTML,
and controls the creation of new editors instances. 
</UL>

<H2>Control Tool</H2>
<A NAME="control-tool">

<!-- In the current prototype, the control tool looks something like this:
&lt;IMG SRC="control.gif"&gt; -->
The current prototype shows an overview of the module import graph, giving
a good impression of the internal structure of the specification.
A number of buttons and menu items give access to the functionality
of the tool.
The control tool must provide the following functionality:
<UL>
<LI> Load a module and all its submodules.
<LI> Show the import relation between the currently loaded modules.
<LI> Show a list of all currently loaded modules.
<LI> Save changes in a specific module.
<LI> Save all elements that have been changed since the last 
     save operations, be it modules or terms.
<LI> Remove a module from the Meta-Environment, even if some
     other module still depends on this module. Modules that are now
     no longer in working order, should be 'greyed out' somehow.
<LI> Inspect and change the list of search-paths in which the Meta-Environment
     searches for new modules.
<LI> Set and/or change the directory in which the compiler writes the
     generated C programs.
<LI> Create new module and term editors.
<LI> Show a list of currently active module editors and term editors,
     and enable the user to activate (bring them to the front) and
     remove them.
<LI> Quit the Meta-Environment.
</UL>

<H3>Extensibility</H3>
In the future, we can imagine all kinds of other operations on modules
or even whole specifications. Examples include queries on specifications
to select all modules using a specific function, calculating some
complexity metrics to find possible weak spots in a specification, or 
restructure specifications based on some clustering results.
These kind of extensions can be implemented in separate tools, but the
user interface extension needed to access this new functionality must
be added to the existing user interface. In order to do this, the
control tool must provide a way to add user interface items like
buttons and menu items, from within the controlling ToolBus script.
This allows tools to add new functionality <EM>at runtime!</EM>

<A NAME="hybrid-editor">
<H2>Hybrid Editor</H2>

<!--The structure editor currently looks like this:
&lt;IMG SRC="structedit.gif"&gt; -->
The hybrid editor must provide the following functionality:
<UL>
<LI> Editing of both modules and terms.
<LI> Provide a 'structure editing mode' and a 'text editing' mode.
     In text editing mode, the editor will provide all the usual
     operations like cut/copy/paste, search and replace, etc.
     In structure editing mode, the user can perform operations on
     subtrees of the term/module. Typical operations include:
     <UL> 
     <LI> Show the sort of the current subtree (focus).
     <LI> Provide a notion of placeholders, which represent
          a hole in the tree.
     <LI> Replace the current subtree with another subtree of the same
          sort, for instance with a placeholder.
     <LI> Replace a placeholder with a context-free function
          optionally containing new placeholders, to build a term
          using template expansion.
     </UL> 
<LI> The user must be able to switch from 'structure editing mode'
     to 'text editing mode' by starting to type text.
<LI> To switch from 'text editing mode' to 'structure editing mode',
     the text in the editor must be parsed.
<LI> When editing a term, the user must be able to rewrite the term 
     currently in the editor.
</UL>

<H3>Extensibility</H3>
Just like the control tool, the structure editor needs an extensible
user interface to allow flexible addition of new functionality.
In this way, typecheckers, compilers, and other tools can be connected
to the user interface when they become available.
It should provide facilities to combine results of the evaluation
of different terms.

<A NAME="parser-generator">
<H2>Parser Generator</H2>

Given the syntax definition of a language (as defined in the Sdf parts of the
modules in a specification),
a parse table must be generated for parsing the equations in the modules
and terms.
A parse table interpreter (or simply stated: a parser) uses this table to parse
terms and equations.
The parser generator should be able to generate this parse table given a list
of Sdf modules.

<H3>Extensibility</H3>
The parse table should contain information indicating which transitions
in the table are valid for a specific module. So, for an entire
specification only one parse table is needed, the modular structure of
the specification is thus coded in the parse table.

<A NAME="parser">
<H2>Parser</H2>

The parser must provide the following basic functionality:
<UL>
<LI> Parsing of a text given a parse table and a module name.
This module name can be:
<UL>
<LI> Sdf(2) if the Sdf part of a module must be parsed. 
<LI> a user defined module name extended with syntax rules for
equations if the Asf part of a module must be parsed.
<LI> a user defined module name if the text of an ordinary term must be
parsed.
</UL>
<LI> Construction of a parse tree in AsFix format if the parse was successful.
<LI> Generation of error messages if the text contains some syntax error.
<LI> A mechanism to store parse tables, so that a parse table need not
be regenerated for every text that must be parsed.
<LI> A mechanism to select only these entries of a parse table which are
valid for a specific Sdf modules.
</UL>

<A NAME="evaluator">
<H2>Evaluator</H2>

We consider both the interpreter, and generated C executables
as instances of the evaluator.
The basic functionality of the interpreter is rewriting terms given a set
of equations.
The generated C executables take a term and rewrites it by the C program.

<P> The minimal functionality of the interpreter is:
<UL>
<LI> Rewriting a term given some module name.
<LI> Construction of a normal form.
<LI> A mechanism to store sets of equations, so that these need not be
retrieved fore every term that must be rewritten.
</UL>

<P> The minimal functionality of the generated C executables is:
<UL>
<LI> Rewriting a term given some module name.
<LI> Construction of a normal form.
</UL>

<H3>Extensions</H3>
Enabling the interpreter to use compiled modules when rewriting terms.
Provide origin tracking information during rewriting in the interpreter
and the generated C executables.
Storing intermediate rewrite results for functions annotated by
the user with the memo-attribute.
Provide facilities to incorporate incremental rewriting techniques.

<A NAME="compiler">
<H2>Compiler</H2>

Given a module name the compiler generates C programs, these C programs
consist of functions corresponding to the context-free functions in the
specification.
Furthermore functions are generated to register local function definitions,
to resolve external function calls and to transform AsFix terms into
the internal term representation used by the C functions.
The registering and resolving of function definitions and calls is
necessary to enable the separate compilation of Asf+Sdf modules.

<H3>Extensions</H3>

The generated C code should be extended with so-called "active" predicates
to enable to possibility to rewrite over other modules than the top
module. This is needed when the generated C executables are to replace
the interpreter, because if a term is to be rewritten over a lower
level module  not all equations may be active.
Generate C code which takes care of origin tracking.
Incorporate functionality to store intermediate rewrite results to enable
memo functions.
Provide a mechanism to implement heavily used modules such as the integers
directly in C.

<P> The interpreter and the generated C executables should
<EM>all</EM> be based on the same Asf semantics.

<A NAME="debugger">
<H2>Debugger</H2>

The debugger is able to debug specications that are reduced using
the evaluator. When a term is to be reduced in debug mode, the
evaluator connects to the debugger, and generates events related
to the reduction process. The debugger processes these events
by highlighting the appropriate lines in the source code of the
specification, and showing the values of variables. The user can
influence the execution by setting breakpoints and stepping through
the specification one equation at a time, or even one condition at
a time.

<H3>Extensibility</H3>

In the future, origin tracking could be used to generate debugging
support in the generated environments.

<A NAME="module-database">
<H2>Module Database</H2>

The basic functionality of both the module database is to
store trees representing modules. The reason for separating
module and term database is that in a standalone environment the
Meta-Environment specific functionality of the module database is not
needed, this will be explained more elaborately below.

The module database should provide the following functionality:
<UL>
<LI>Storage, retrieval, replacement, and deletion of modules with (based on)
version numbers.
<LI>Calculation of the import relations of modules.
<LI>Keeping track of missing modules in the database
with respect to the import relations.
<LI>Keeping track of modifications in the syntax part and the consequences
for tools depending on this information such as
the equation parts (interpreter),
terms (term database), parse tables (parser), TeX and HTML code (unparser),
and generated C executables.
<LI>Retrieval of the syntax part of modules given a list of modules names
and version numbers.
<LI>Retrieval of the equation part of modules given a list of modules names
and version numbers.
<LI>Reshuffling of equations given a list of modules names
and version numbers and construction of new modules.
</UL>

The term database contains only terms constructed by the user or derived
by the evaluator. These terms correspond to syntax modules available in
the module database, if any. In a standalone environment there will
be terms of the so-called top module, e.g., Pico or COBOL, and reduction
results, e.g., booleans values in case of type check results, transformed
programs, or value environments. 
The term database should provide the following functionality:
<UL>
<LI>Storage, retrieval, replacement, and deletion of term with (based on)
version numbers and module names.
</UL>

<H3>Extensibility</H3>
Both the module and term database could provide functionality to pose queries
on the contents of the database. These queries can be used to implement 
search facilities, global search and replace facilities, derivation of
relations between various trees in the database, etc.

<A NAME="unparser">
<H2>Unparser</H2>

The unparser must deal with the pretty printing of normalized terms to be shown
to the user after rewriting, and the typesetting of modules in LaTeX or
on the web via HTML.
The formatting of terms and modules is expressed in language and 
back-end independent box-oriented formatting language.

<P>The unparser or pretty printer should provide the following functionality:
<UL>
<LI>Unparsing of a term (in AsFix format) given a list consisting of pairs
of context-free syntax rules and box expressions and resulting in a
modified term (spaces and newlines will be added to the AsFix representation).
<LI>Calculation of the box expression given the AsFix representation of a
module, and transformation of the box expression into TeX or HTML code.
<LI>A mechanism to store the list consisting of pairs of
context-free syntax rules and box expressions.
</UL>

<H2>Unparser Generator</H2>
<A NAME="unparser-generator">

The unparser generator should generate a list consisting of pairs
of context-free syntax rules and initial box expressions.
Users should be able to modify the initial box expressions in order
to fine tune the pretty printing.
