    <h1 ALIGN="CENTER">The Asf+Sdf Meta-Environment</h1>

    This page describes the second generation Asf+Sdf Meta-Environment
    developed at <a href="http://www.cwi.nl">CWI</a> and 
    <a href="http://www.wins.uva.nl">UvA</a>. 

    <p>The purpose of the Asf+Sdf Meta-Environment is to support the
       development of language definitions in Asf+Sdf. Asf+Sdf is an
       algebraic specification formalism baised towards describing
       the syntax and semantics of (programming) language. The main
       application areas of Asf+Sdf are language prototyping, and
       reengineering.
            
    <h2>Development team</h2>
    <p> The Asf+Sdf Meta-Environment is developed and maintained by:
       <ul>
          <li><a href="http://www.cwi.nl/~markvdb">Mark van den Brand</a>:
                general design, compiler, parser generator,
                interpreter, and module database.
          <li><a href="http://www.cwi.nl/~mdejonge">Merijn de Jonge</a>
		unparser, ToLaTeX, and unparser generator.
          <li><a href="http://www.cwi.nl/~kuipers">Tobias Kuipers</a>:
		general design, text- and structure editor.
          <li><a href="http://www.cwi.nl/~leon">Leon Moonen</a>
		general design, and user interface.
          <li><a href="http://adam.wins.uva.nl/~olivierp">Pieter Olivier</a>
		general design, interpreter, and debugger.
          <li><a href="http://www.cwi.nl/~js">Jeroen Scheerder</a>
		general design, and parser.
       </ul>

        If you have specific questions concerning the functionality of
        one of the listed components please address the responsible
        developer directly.

    <h2>Components</h2>
    <p> The Asf+Sdf Meta-Environment consists of the following main
        components:
        <ul>
           <li> Parser Generator.
           <li> Parser.
           <li> (Unparser Generator).
           <li> (Unparser).
           <li> Compiler.
           <li> Interpreter.
           <li> (Debugger).
           <li> Text editor: xemacs.
           <li> Structure editor.
           <li> User-interface.
           <li> ToolBus as software coordination architecture.
           <li> ATerms as interchange format.
       </ul>

    <h2>How to use the Asf+Sdf Meta-Environment</h2>
    <p>The Asf+Sdf Meta-Environment is still in a pre-release state.
       Both at CWI and at the UvA a pre-release version of the new
       Asf+Sdf Meta-Environment is installed: 
       <ul>
         <li> At the UvA: /home/gipe/petr/bin (meta: 1 Dec 1999, 09:57)
         <li> At CWI: 
           <ul>    
             <li> /ufs/gipe/petr/linux/i686/bin (meta: 24 Sep 1999, 16:47)
             <li> /ufs/gipe/petr/irix/mips/bin (meta: 13 Oct 1999, 17:29)
             <li> /ufs/gipe/petr/sunos/sparc/bin (meta: 5 Nov 1999, 09:08)
           </ul>
       </ul>
       <p> The date and time between the brackets are the installation time
           of the executables. 

       <p> By adding the appropriate to our `paths' the new 
           Asf+Sdf Meta-Environment can be activated via the
           command `meta'.

       <p> It is possible to create a file `meta.conf' which contains
           all search paths that have to be inspected in order to obtain all
           modules. If all modules are in the same directory
           please create this file as well, but with only `.' as content.
           If you are planning to use the compiler then make sure that
           the variable `COMPILER_OUTPUT' is initialized if you want
           the generated C files and Makefiles in a separate directory, e.g.,
           <ul>
             <li> setenv COMPILER_OUTPUT /home/user/c-source
           </ul>
           This mechanism may changed in the near future.
            
    <h2>Conversion from Sdf to Sdf2</h2>
    <p> There are a number of tools to support the conversion from
        Sdf to Sdf2. These tools will be made available to you soon.

    <h2>Known bugs and other shortcomings</h2>
    <p>The current implementation of the new Asf+Sdf Meta-Environment is
       still in a pre-release phase. One of the major changes is the redesign
       of the ToolBus script. The following list is far from complete but
       if you run into a problem which is not on the list please contact
       us.
       <ul>
         <li> The current implementation of the structure editor is extremely
              slow.
         <li> If more than one module can not be found one of the pop up menu 
              of the user interface gets into trouble.
         <li> The manipulation of `empty' modules is not full proof.
         <li> The parsing of the text of the focus if the focus is not
              the entire `program' is not yet possible.
         <li> The propagation of modifications in the syntax section of
              a module to the rest of the specification is not yet fully 
              tested.
       </ul>

     <h2>Version numbers of components</h2>

     <p> Each main component has its own version number, the most up-to-date
         version numbers are:
        <ul> 
          <li> ToolBus: ToolBus-0.11.6 
          <li> ATerm library: version 0.19
          <li> sglr: v2.21 
          <li> ...
       </ul>
