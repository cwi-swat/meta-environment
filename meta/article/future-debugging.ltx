\subsection{Debugging}

Debugging in the context of the new \metaenv\ has three dimensions:
\begin{enum}
\item Debugging the new \metaenv\ itself.
\item Debugging \asdf\ specifications.
\item Debugging programs developed using generated programming environments.
\end{enum}

Our recent work on generic debugging techniques for distributed,
heterogeneous environments\cite{COORD97.tide}
 cover both dimension {\tt 1} and {\tt 2}. 
More research is needed to also use this technology to cover dimension {\tt 3}.
