Version 0.3.3
  * user-manual.ps and exercises.ps are now included in the distribution. 
  * Bug fix: equations of module of which the syntax was changed were not
    made unavailable.

Version 0.3.2
  * relaxed the version checking of wish. If the script is unable to
    check the version of wish, it generates a warning banner. After that
    it assumes the right version is available in the environment.

      .eqs     -> .asf
      .asf.baf -> .eqs
      .eqs.baf -> .asf.baf
      .eqs.tbl -> .asf.tbl

    in a directory.
