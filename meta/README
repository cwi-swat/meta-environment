This is the README file for the ASF+SDF Meta-Environment distribution.

Installation instructions:

Prerequisite tools: 
To compile this distribution you will need the following tools:
 -- gmake (GNU make, from <http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html>)
 -- noweb (The noweb set of literate programming utilities, from 
      <http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~nr/noweb/>)
 -- jdk (The Java Development Kit, from 
      <http://www.javasoft.com/products/jdk/>)
 -- wish (A user-interface system, part of Tcl/Tk, from 
      <http://www.tclconsortium.org/resources/download.html>) Make sure you
      get version 8.0 or higher.

As well as a full set of UNIX development utilities.

Platform specific notes:
  On IRIX 6.3 you will need gcc to compile. cc will crash during linking of 
  certain executables.

The Meta-Environment distribution depends on three other distributions. 
Using CVS, you can get these distributions as follows:

- cd to the directory just above new-meta (new-meta/..)
- issue the following commands: 
$ cvs -d artemis.cwi.nl:/ufs/gipe/CVS-repository checkout gel
$ cvs -d artemis.cwi.nl:/ufs/gipe/CVS-repository checkout toolbus
$ cvs -d adam.wins.uva.nl:/home/gipe/CVS checkout aterm-lib
(and, if you hadn't done so already)
$ cvs -d adam.wins.uva.nl:/home/gipe/CVS checkout new-meta

Now everything needs to be configured and compiled.

Here is the basic set-up: These commands are the minimal config options for 
the Meta-Environment to compile: (and remember, order is important here)
This will install everything in the directory new-meta/../{bin,lib,include}
$ cd gel
$ ./configure
$ gmake install
$ cd ..
$ cd toolbus
$ ./configure --with-java
$ gmake install
$ cd ..
$ cd aterm-lib
$ ./configure
$ gmake install
$ cd ..
$ cd new-meta
$ ./config
$ gmake install
$ cd ..


After compilation:
To run the distribution you will need the following tools:
 -- tcldot (A graph visualization library from AT&T. Part of their graphviz
      package, from <http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/>)
      You will need to set the variable TCLLIBPATH to the directory containing 
      the file Tcldot.so.x.x (where x.x is the version number)

If you now add the path to the directory new-meta/../bin to your PATH, you 
are al set up.

The Meta-Environment development team wishes you happy environmentaling, 
and may all your grammars be context free.
