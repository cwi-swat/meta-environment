       www.gnu.org

   -AT&T Graphviz, available from:
       www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/

   -Xemacs, available from:
       www.xemacs.org/

   -Tcl/Tk, available from:
       dev.scriptics.com/software/

   -The ATerm library, available from:
       www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/

   -The ToolBus, available from:
       www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/

   -The pt-support library, available from:
       www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/

   -The sdf-support library, available from:
       www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/

   -The asf-support library, available from:
       www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/

   -The ASF rewriting engines, available from:
       www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/   

   -The Scannerless Generalized LR Parser (sglr), available from:

   -The SDF2 parser generator, available from:
       www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/              
   
   -The ASF+SDF compiler runtime library, available from:
       www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/

   Before building the ASF+SDF Meta-Environment, you should first install these
   packages.

2) Configuring the ASF+SDF Meta-Environment.

   Assuming that the third party tools, aterm library, the toolbus, the support 
   libraries, the runtime library, the rewrite engines, the parser generator, 
   and sglr are installed in <xemacs>, <graphviz>, <tk>, <aterm>, <toolbus>, 
   <pt-support>, <sdf-support>, <asf-support>, <asc-support>, <asf>, <pgen>, 
   and <sglr> respectively and that the ASF+SDF Meta-Environment should be 
   installed in <meta> then the following command will configure the 
   Meta-Environment accordingly:

   ./configure --prefix=<meta> \
               --with-xemacs=<xemacs> \
               --with-graphviz=<graphviz> \
               --with-tk=<tk> \
               --with-aterm=<aterm> \
               --with-toolbus=<toolbus> \
               --with-pt-support=<pt-support> \
               --with-sdf-support=<sdf-support> \
               --with-asf-support=<asf-support> \
               --with-asc-support=<asc-support> \
               --with-asf=<asf> \
               --with-sglr=<sglr> \
               --with-pgen=<pgen>

   Note. Default behaviour of configure is that it will look for libraries
         in <prefix>/lib and for executables in your search paths. So,
         you do not need to specify the locations of all these packages
         explicitly (as we did in the example above).

   If you use gcc, pgen is built with "gcc -Wall -g -O2". If you prefer
   different options use --with-cflags="<options>" when you run configure.

   ./configure --help gives a detailed list of configuration options.       

3) Building the ASF+SDF Meta-Environment.

   Assuming that GNU make is called "gmake" on your system then the
   following commands will build and install the ASF+SDF Meta-Environment:

   gmake
   gmake install

4) Checking the ASF+SDF Meta-Environment.

   The ASF+SDF Meta-Environment can be tested via:

   gmake check

5) Bug reporting and support.
