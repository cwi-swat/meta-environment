This is the README file for the ASF+SDF Meta-Environment distribution.

Installation instructions:

Prerequisite tools: 
To compile this distribution you will need the following tools:
 -- gmake (GNU make, from <http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html>)
 -- noweb (The noweb set of literate programming utilities, from 
      <http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~nr/noweb/>)
 -- jdk (The Java Development Kit, from 
      <http://www.javasoft.com/products/jdk/>)
 -- wish (A user-interface system, part of Tcl/Tk, from 
      <http://www.tclconsortium.org/resources/download.html>) Make sure you
      get version 8.0 or higher.
 -- tcldot (A graph visualization library from AT&T. Part of their graphviz
      package, from <http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/>)
      Move the directory lib/Tcldot to some convenient place. This is
      the only directory from the distribution that is used. Remember
      the location, you'll need it later.


As well as a full set of UNIX development utilities.

The Meta-Environment distribution depends on three other distributions. 
Using CVS, you can get these distributions as follows:

- cd to the directory just above new-meta (new-meta/..)
- issue the following commands: 
$ cvs -d artemis.cwi.nl:/ufs/gipe/CVS-repository checkout gel
$ cvs -d artemis.cwi.nl:/ufs/gipe/CVS-repository checkout toolbus
$ cvs -d adam.wins.uva.nl:/home/gipe/CVS checkout aterm-lib
(and, if you hadn't done so already)
$ cvs -d adam.wins.uva.nl:/home/gipe/CVS checkout new-meta

Now everything needs to be configured and compiled.

Here is the basic set-up: These commands are the minimal config options for 
the Meta-Environment to compile: (and remember, order is important here)
This will install everything in the directory new-meta/../{bin,lib,include}
$ cd gel
$ ./configure
$ gmake install
$ cd ..
$ cd toolbus
$ ./configure --with-java
$ gmake install
$ cd ..
$ cd aterm-lib
$ ./configure
$ gmake install
$ cd ..
$ cd new-meta
$ ./config --with-tcldot=/path/to/directory/Tcldot (see above)
$ gmake install
$ cd ..


After compilation:

If you now add the path to the directory new-meta/../bin to your PATH, you 
are al set up.

The Meta-Environment development team wishes you happy environmentaling, 
and may all your grammars be context free.
