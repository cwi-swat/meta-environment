This is the README file for the ASF+SDF Meta-Environment distribution.


Installation instructions:


 * Prerequisite tools

   To compile this distribution you will need the following items:

    -- gmake (GNU make, from <http://www.gnu.org/software/make/>)
    -- jdk (The Java Development Kit, from
         <http://www.javasoft.com/products/jdk/>). Make sure you get version
         1.1 or higher.
    -- wish (A user-interface system, part of Tcl/Tk, from
         <http://dev.scriptics.com/software/>). Make sure you
         get version 8.0.1 or higher.
    -- graphviz (A graph visualization library from AT&T), from
         <http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/>)
    -- xemacs (A text editor for X-windows systems, available from
         <http://www.xemacs.org/>). Make sure you get version 20.4 or newer.
         The Meta-Environment is untested with other versions of xemacs, but
         may very well work. (Or may not...)
    -- the common development utilities typically existent in a basic
         UNIXish environment.


* Prerequisites for testing

     In order to be able to test meta by executing
         $ make check
     you will need the JUnit Java Unit Testing framework. It is available
     from <http://www.xprogramming.com/software.htm>.
     Note that some components have substantial memory requirements.
     These may differ somewhat across machine architectures; for the
     check target, experiences have shown a practical minimum of about
     110-120MB, roughly.


* Platform support

     The new-meta environment has been installed successfully on
     the following platforms:

     -- Sun Solaris/Sparc >= 2.5, Sun Solaris/iX86 >= 2.6
     -- SGI IRIX/Mips >= 6.2
     -- NetBSD/PowerPC, NetBSD/iX86 >= 1.4
     -- Mac OS X Server/PPC >= 1.0
     -- Mac OS X/PPC DP2, DP3
     -- LinuxPPC/PowerPC >= 2.0, MkLinux/PowerPC 3.0, Linux/iX86 >= 2.0

     The new-meta environment has been tried without success on
     the following platforms:

     -- Digital (`Compaq') Alpha & OSF1 v4.0 (`Compaq Tru64 Unix')


  * Dependencies

    The Meta-Environment distribution depends on the aterm and toolbus
    distributions which can be downloaded from the CWi web-site:

       http://www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/aterm/
       http://www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/toolbus/

    Before building the ASF+SDF Meta-Environment download and install both
    distributions. Please consult the web-site for installation
    instructions.

    To ease the compilation and installation process of the
    Meta-Environment, we also offer a complete distribution (Meta Completa),
    which bundles all required CWI software packages and contains a strongly
    simplified installation. See the web-site
    http://www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/ for more information.


  * Configuring and compiling: final installation

    Let's assume the `aterm' and `toolbus' directories are located in the
    directory `/some/prefix', that graphviz is installed in `/path/to/graphviz',
    and that you want to install the ASF+SDF Meta-Enironment in
    `/some/prefix'. Further we assume that the Meta-Environment sources are
    unpacked in `/meta/source/` and that the `make' command is in fact GNU
    make (you may have to use `gmake' or `gnumake', depending on your site's
    configuration).  Furthermore, you should make sure that your java
    installation's setup is correct, and that your CLASSPATH variable points
    to the Java classes that came with your JDK.

    Here is the basic set-up.  These commands are the minimal config
    options for the Meta-Environment to compile.  Note that the order
    of execution is significant.  This will install everything in the
    directories /some/prefix/{bin,lib,include,classes,share,man}.

    Make sure that your PATH points to the above /some/prefix/bin
    directory, for instance by typing:

      $ PATH=/some/prefix/bin:${PATH}; export PATH

    for the sh family of shells, or alternatively (for csh-ish shells):

      % setenv PATH /some/prefix/bin:${PATH}

    PATH being set properly, the installation procedure proceeds
    as follows:

      $ cd /meta/source/meta-<version>
      $ ./configure --prefix=/some/prefix \
                    --with-toolbus=/some/prefix \
                    --with-aterm=/some/prefix \
                    --with-graphviz=/path/to/graphviz
      $ make 
      $ make install

    At this point, everything should be configured, compiled, and
    installed.  Once you have added the path to the directory
    /some/prefix/bin to your PATH (see above), you are all set up.


The Meta-Environment development team wishes you happy environmentaling;
and may all your grammars be context free.

                                     per me si van nell'eterno dolore;
                                     per me si va tra la perduta gente.
                                     Giustizia mosse il mio alto Fattore;
                                     fecemi la divina Potestate,
                                     la somma Sapienza e il primo Amore.
                                     Dinanzi a me non fur cose create,
                                     se non eterne, ed io eterno duro:
                                     lasciate ogni speranza, voi ch'entrate.''

                                               -- Dante Alighieri, `Inferno'
