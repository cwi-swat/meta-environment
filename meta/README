This is the README file for the ASF+SDF Meta-Environment distribution.

Installation instructions:

Prerequisite tools: 
To compile this distribution you will need the following tools:
 -- gmake (GNU make, from <http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html>)
 -- noweb (The noweb set of literate programming utilities, from 
      <http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~nr/noweb/>)
 -- jdk (The Java Development Kit, from 
      <http://www.javasoft.com/products/jdk/>). Make sure you get version
      1.1 or higher.
 -- wish (A user-interface system, part of Tcl/Tk, from 
      <http://www.tclconsortium.org/resources/download.html>) Make sure you
      get version 8.0 or higher.
 -- tcldot (A graph visualization library from AT&T. Part of their graphviz
      package, from <http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/>)
      Move the directory lib/Tcldot to some convenient place. This is
      the only directory from the distribution that is used. Remember
      the location, you'll need it later.
      (At CWI/UvA, it will be under ~gipe/petr/lib/Tcldot)
 -- xemacs (A text editor for X-windows systems, available from 
      <http://www.xemacs.org/>). Make sure you get version 20.4 or newer,
      and make sure your installation includes an executable named 
      "gnuclient". Then add the line
        (gnuserv-start)
      to your ~/.emacs file.
      The Meta-Environment is untested with other versions of xemacs, but
      may very well work. (Or may not...)

As well as a full set of UNIX development utilities.

The Meta-Environment distribution depends on four other distributions. 
Using CVS, you can get these distributions as follows: (if you have accounts
at both UvA and CWI. External distribution will be available at a later stage)

- cd to the directory just above new-meta (new-meta/..)
- issue the following commands: 
$ cvs -d heijnst.cwi.nl:/ufs/gipe/CVS-repository checkout gel
$ cvs -d heijnst.cwi.nl:/ufs/gipe/CVS-repository checkout toolbus
$ cvs -d adam.wins.uva.nl:/home/gipe/CVS checkout aterm-lib
$ cvs -d adam.wins.uva.nl:/home/gipe/CVS checkout aterm
(and, if you hadn't done so already)
$ cvs -d adam.wins.uva.nl:/home/gipe/CVS checkout new-meta

Now everything needs to be configured and compiled.

Here is the basic set-up: These commands are the minimal config options for 
the Meta-Environment to compile: (and remember, order is important here)
This will install everything in the directory new-meta/../{bin,lib,include}.
Make sure that your PATH points to the above new-meta/../bin directory, for 
instance by typing:
$ setenv PATH /path/to/new-meta/../bin:${PATH}
(if you have a csh)
Then proceed as follows:
$ cd gel
$ ./configure
$ gmake install
$ cd ..
$ cd toolbus
$ ./configure --prefix=.. --with-java
$ gmake install
$ cd ..
$ cd aterm-lib
$ ./configure
$ gmake install
$ cd ..
$ cd aterm
$ autoconf
$ ./configure
$ gmake install
$ cd ..
$ cd new-meta
$ ./configure --with-tcldot=/path/to/directory/Tcldot (see above)
$ gmake install
$ cd ..


After compilation:

If you now add the path to the directory new-meta/../bin to your PATH, you 
are al set up. Furthermore, you should make sure that your java installation 
correctly setup, and that your CLASSPATH variable points to the Java classes 
that come with your JDK.

The Meta-Environment development team wishes you happy environmentaling, 
and may all your grammars be context free.
