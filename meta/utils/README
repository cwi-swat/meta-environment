Descriptions


    Name

      gen-table

    Synopsis

      gen-table [-v] AsFix-File-0 ... AsFix-File-n

    Description

      From AsFix representations of syntax definitions, specified
      as arguments, gen-table builds parse tables.  Input files
      can be in Asfix2 or AsFix1 format, but it should be noted
      that file extensions are used to determine the format:
      ".asfix2" is taken to be an AsFix2 file, and ".asfix1"/".asfix"
      are considered to be AsFix1.  Options are:

        -v   switches gen-table into a more verbose operating mode



    Name

      parse-sdf2

    Synopsis

      parse-sdf2 [-12] [-dlv] [-o outfile] Sdf2-File-0 ... Sdf2-File-n

    Description

      The SDF2 input files are parsed, and the resulting parse tree
      is written into AsFix format.  Options are:

        -1   write files in AsFix1 output (with "asfix1" extension)

        -2   write files in AsFix2 output (with "asfix2" extension)

        -d   switch parser into debugging mode

        -l   tells parser to log a few obscure statistics

        -v   switches into verbose operating mode

        -o _file_
             write output to file (note: does not combine well with
             multiple input files)


    Name

      sdf2table

    Synopsis

      sdf2table [-v] Sdf2-File-0 ... Sdf2-File-n

    Description

      Builds parse tables for the specified SDF2 input files,
      writing output (if successful) into correspondingly named
      files with `tbl' extension.  Options are:

        -v   verbose operating mode
