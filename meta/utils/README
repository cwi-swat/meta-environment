Descriptions


    Name

      gen-table

    Synopsis

      gen-table [-v] AsFix-File-0 ... AsFix-File-n

    Description

      From AsFix representations of syntax definitions, specified
      as arguments, gen-table builds parse tables.  Input files
      can be in Asfix2 or AsFix1 format, but it should be noted
      that file extensions are used to determine the format:
      ".asfix2" is taken to be an AsFix2 file, and ".asfix1"/".asfix"
      are considered to be AsFix1.  Options are:

        -v   switches gen-table into a more verbose operating mode



    Name

      parse-sdf2

    Synopsis

      parse-sdf2 [-12] [-dlv] [-o outfile] Sdf2-File-0 ... Sdf2-File-n

    Description

      The SDF2 input files are parsed, and the resulting parse tree
      is written into AsFix format.  Options are:

        -1   write files in AsFix1 output (with "asfix1" extension)

        -2   write files in AsFix2 output (with "asfix2" extension)

        -d   switch parser into debugging mode

        -l   tells parser to log a few obscure statistics

        -v   switches into verbose operating mode

        -o _file_
             write output to file (note: does not combine well with
             multiple input files)


    Name

      sdf2table

    Synopsis

      sdf2table [-v] Sdf2-File-0 ... Sdf2-File-n

    Description

      Builds parse tables for the specified SDF2 input files,
      writing output (if successful) into correspondingly named
      files with `tbl' extension.  Options are:

        -v   verbose operating mode


    Name

      Sdf2.baf

    Description

      This is the parse table for SDF2.  Except from the fact that it
      is in in Binary Asfix Format, it should be identical to the
      Sdf2.tbl file as it is found in the parser's regress test suite.

      Note: this is a binary file.  Due to CVS' design, damage to
      binary files may occur on platforms with a broken end-of-line
      convention; if that bites you, use the `trm2baf' tool to
      regenerate the file from Sdf2.tbl (see above).
