META - an interactive environment to develop ASF+SDF specifications

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<meta> [-B<c> I<directory>] [-B<dh>] [-B<T> I<port>] [-B<vV>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<meta> is an interactive environment for the development of ASF+SDF
specifications. It offers syntax directed editors for ASF+SDF
specifications, an interpreter, a compiler to generated C code,
parser, parse table generator, and a user-interface which vizualizes
the modular structure of a specification. All these components are
connected to a software coordination architecture (ToolBus).

A number of options can be supplied; these are as follows:

=over 4

=item B<-c> I<directory> 
This directory is used by the ASF+SDF2C compiler, the generated 
auxilary AsFix files and C files are written in this directory
as well as the Makefiles. 

=item -d

Run the Meta-Environment in debug mode, the ToolBus viewer.

=item -B<h>

Displays concise usage information.

=item -B<T> I<port>

Specifies B<TB_PORT> for the ToolBus.

=item B<-v>

Operate in verbose mode.

=item B[-V]

Returns the current version number.
