Some of the packages of the New-meta environment distribution are
controlled by autoconf and automake (see www.gnu.org).

Before running ./configure to configure the system and to create
Makefiles from Makefile.in's, you should first run ./reconf
which generates among others Makefile.in's from Makefile.am's for all
automake controlled packages.

Running ./reconf might give several warnings about non-existent
files which can safely be ignored because automake will install
these missing files for you.

It is essential that you have an up-to-date version of automake
(version 1.4 or above).

Note for CWI developers. Adding "automake" to your ~/.pkgrc file
in order to use an up-to-date version of automake.
