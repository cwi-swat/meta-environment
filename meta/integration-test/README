This directory contains a number of integration tests for the ASF+SDF
Meta-Environment.

usage:
   make test      to run the tests

adding new tests:
-Add a new subdir for the test and add the name of this directory to the
 SUBDIRS variable in the Makefile.
-Create a Makefile in the new directory that contains the "test" target.
 Take a look at ParsePicoTerm/Makefile to get an idea about how to write
 your tests.

Note. All files created during a test run should be removed before the end
of the test run.
