   * editor-manager now knows the module each editor is related to.

     text-editors and ToolBus-processes are removed.

   * An editor-manager now dispenses editor-ids. This implies you
     cannot get multiple instances of editors editing the same file

     to be killed as well.

     strengthened ambiguity report, that includes a set of
     (position, related-productions) tuples

   * In-output warns when it encounters unresolvable entries in searchpath.
   * In-output warns when more than one match for a given module is found.

   * In-output is no longer linked against AsFix and asc-support libraries.

   * Xemacs opens new window for each file.
