2003/05/30 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * removed module-db subtree from configure.in, but still left it in the
   source tree.
 * made dump of parsetable and dump-equations use the same schema
 * fixed bugs in dump-equations

2003/05/28 (markvdb@cs.vu.nl)
 * Added a number of "empty" assignments.
 * Replace the calculation of the import-graph by 
   a more direct derivation and display by meta-studio.
 * Editing of syntax modules with errors is enabled again.

2003/05/28 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * The meta-studio.idef subscribes to notes before executing the studio
   to prevent loosing any notes.

2003/05/27 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Term-store has two types of tables now: str and term. 
 * Pos-info is added up to depth 4 for equations as it used to  be,
   but the script now contains a magical value!
 * Factored out common functionality between all 'main' processes such
   as meta-studio, the standalone dumpers and the standalone editors
 * Renamed ToolBus files for the standalone tools! See asfsdf-meta/src for 
   examples on how to use them.
 * Reactivated invalidation of asf-trees and parsetables 
   (not working correctly yet)
 

2003/05/27 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Imports are filtered against the contents of the term-store.
 * meta.tb now has an explicit starting order of initial processes.
 * Some variables set to dummy values.
 * Some ATBpack and unpacks added.

2003/05/27 ({jong,jurgenv}@cwi.nl)
 * fixed a lot of stupid bugs in in-output (unneeded free calls for example)

2003/05/26 ({markvdb,jurgenv}@cwi.nl)
 * In-output idef messages are all prefix with "io-"
 * A path in the module name is always up to the module name, not
   even including a part of the compound module name
 * ...-named-... functions removed from in-output because there are
   now only two representations of a filename:
     1. A full absolute filename including path and extension
     2. [Path,Name,Extension] where the concatenation should form
        a path of type 1. Name can contain directory separators.
 * Editor-manager takes a name of type 1 and does not concatenate
   extensions anymore
 * All tools and processes adapted to use the new filename conventions
 * Posinfo is now added with the correct full filenames (style 1) again

2003/05/21 ({markvdb,jurgenv}@cwi.nl)
 * The coordination part of the old module-db is now implemented
   in ToolBus scripts.
 * Module renaming is now implemented in the sdf-support package, not
   in module-db and asf-operations, or elan-operations any more. The
   tool is called sdf-renaming. It takes a module and the current import
   relation and returns a list of modules that are copies of the original
   module with the appropriate renamings applied.
 * Deactivated the module-db subtree in this package. It will remain here
   for a while to do some browsing, but it is now officially dead code.
 * The hook message postprocess-collected-semantics-hook-result has
   been changed to take a <str> for a module name instead of a <term>.
   Note: asfsdf-meta and elan-env should deal with this change.

Fri May 23 09:40:00 CEST 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * tbscripts/meta.tb: add #ifdef around #include of query-tool.idef
 * src/generic-meta.sh.src: add -I<path> to meta-query tool

Thu May 22 14:42:02 CEST 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * query-tool/**: move to a separate package "meta-query"
 * tbscripts/button-actions.tb: add support for queries
 * tbscripts/query.tb: cleanup (delete) standalone/ui stuff
 * tbscripts/meta.tb: Query processes conditional in toolbus() call
 * src/generic-meta.sh.src: add -q flag to enable query support

2003/05/21 ({markvdb,jurgenv}@cwi.nl)
 * working towards implementing the module-db coordination tasks in ToolBus
   in tbscripts/module-db.tb
 * term-store now has terms as values, not lists anymore
 * all files in module-db/src are now deprecated, do not edit there anymore.

Wed May 21 13:15:45 CEST 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * Added -Werror in in-output and module-db Makefiles.
 * Fixed multiline string-constanct in ATmake construct in module-db/main.c
 * Removed deprecated functionality in in-output/main.c

2003/05/21 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Editing of erroneous syntax modules enabled.

2003/05/20 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * To fix the immediate reduce (without first pressing 'Parse') bug,
   the get-root button action now first pops the current module name from
   the stack.

2003/05/20 ({jurgenv,jong}@cwi.nl)
 * added a number of new functions to the in-output tool:
   - find-file: searches a file in a given number of paths
   - compare-files: checks if filenames point to the same file on the system
   - get-filename: construct filename from dir+name+ext
 * renamed some functions in the in-output tool
 * split parsing, conversion to absolute paths and registering of the
   meta.conf file
 * dialog with io tool extended
 * brought scripts up-to-date with changes in in-output and configuration-
   manager

2003/05/19 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Moved term-store tool to toplevel
 * Copied sdf specific functionality from module-db to sdf-modules tool
   located in the sdf-support package.
 * Partly reimplemented module-db in a ToolBus script that uses only
   the sdf-modules.idef and term-store.idef

2003/05/19 ({jong,markvdb}@cwi.nl)   
 * Added explicit ATBpack and ATBunpack.   
 * Introduced write-term-file.
 * Removed configuration specific stuff from IO.

2003/05/16 ({jurgenv,markvdb}@cwi.nl)
 * Major revision of UI, IO, MDB.
 * NOT YET FINISHED, SO DO NOT UPDATE!

2003/05/15 ({jurgenv,markvdb}@cwi.nl)
 * Created a generic term-store tool
 * Some features are turned off for the moment (module refactorings)

2003/05/14 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Intermediate version of new module-db.

Tue May 13 13:16:20 CEST 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * fix tbscripts/editors.tb and editors/text/text-editor.idef: 
   process TextEditor no longer has any parameters, making it abide
   by our coding standard for the idef of a tool. Instead the parameters
   are passed by a message: edit-text(EditorId, FileName, ButtonList)

Mon May 12 14:13:14 CEST 2003 ({jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl)
 * Fixed bug: LAYOUT-GRAPH process was only started #if METASTUDIO was
   defined, but this #define had been deemed "dead code" earlier

2003/05/10 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Removed dead code taking care of switching between graphbrowser
   and metastudio.

Fri May  9 11:10:03 CEST 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * Add "Clear History" functionalty to MetaStudio, clearing the bottom
   right message pane.
 * Fix indentation level of this ChangeLog which managed to sneak to a
   deeper level again, and since everybody copies the previous one...

2003/05/09 ({markvdb,jurgenv}@cwi.nl)
  * First steps of the restructuring of the "module-db".

2003/05/07 (markvdb@cs.vu.nl)
 * Fixed the annoying behaviour of closing and opening the
   term editor in the demos of Jorgen Iversen and Paul Klint.
   A new button action `close-editor' has been introduced.

2003/04/29 ({iversen,jurgenv}@cwi.nl)
 * Added a new widget to the MetaStudio: a message list
 * Fixed a number of typos and wrong messages in the ToolBus scripts
   that were introduced recently by jurgenv.
 * Added a new type of 'editor' to the button language: message-list.

2003/04/28 (markvdb@cs.vu.nl)
 * Clean up the new button language a bit.
 * Tested it on the boolean transformations.
 * Given some button actions more appropriate names.

2003/04/25 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Deadlock problems caused by dissappearing text editors partially solved by 
   changing the idef of text-editor to use only notes.
 * Processes that send messages to editors made more robust against 
   non-existing editors, or they now listen to notes that declare an
   editor dead.
 * This solved the memory leak introduced by a workaround for the
   previous problem that lead to eternally waiting Text-Editor processes.
 * Replaced assert statements in structure editor by proper handling
   of non-existing editors. 
 * Replaced some assert statements in editor-manager too.
 * All buttons in editors are now handled via the button-language.
   The text-editor knows nothing about the details of buttons anymore.
 * Button names are now list of strings. For example: ["Action","Parse"].
   This will add the "Parse" button to the menu "Action".
   Note that all button scripts will have to be adapted to deal with this.
 * The button language was changed. All actions that had a modulename
   as a direct argument now read it from the stack as a string.
 * Added a new primitive to the button language: 'push-modulename' that
   pushed the modulename of the current editor onto the stack
 * The standard Meta-Environment buttons are now completely externalized
   from the configuration-manager. A file called 'standard.buttons' is
   installed and the configuration-manager reads it in when the 
   Meta-Environment starts up.
 * Used ApiGen to reimplement configuration manager

2003/04/25 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Refactored button-actions to use StackPush/Pop operations
 * Fixed a bug in the structure editor, ViewTree on the root of a term
   caused a core dump.
 * Completely refactored editor managing scripts. All code duplication
   removed. Editor killing simplified (must be tested thoroughly!)

2003/04/24 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * All scripts related to the implementation of the button language
   are now located in a single button-actions.tb script. This script needs
   more refactoring

2003/04/24 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * ViewTree added and Meta-Environment renamed to Term-Actions.

2003/04/16 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Reintroduced the save and print entries in the module menu.

2003/04/15 (markvdb@cs.vu.nl)
 * Repaired a very annoying bug wrt setting of foci. The message
   move-focus-to-root responded with "set-focus" which causes
   quite some interference.

2003/03/30 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Used backquotes to delay calling *-config scripts to after
   configure phase. Otherwise autobundle can't configure all packages
   before building them.

2003/03/28 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added dependency on new graph-support package
 * Added capability of drawing diamonds and ellipses to MetaStudio graph
   panels

2003/03/25 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Restructured the killing of editors, a new process introduced.
   A number of small bugs are solved in this way. There is still
   one major issue with respect reusing an existing term-editor.

2003/03/24 ({markvdb, iversen}@cwi.nl)
 * Added button-action show-area, which takes a modulename as 
   argument and an 
  aterm containing position info from the stack, and then highlights the 
  position, using the module to parse the file containing the position. 

* Also added position-info annotation to all terms.

* Removed button-action add-pos-info.

2003/03/20 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Added a "Delete this module" for a non-existing module, this
   omission was reported by PDM.

2003/03/20 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Removed dependency on shared-objects and jjtraveler. This is taken care
   of by aterm-java-config from now on.

2003/03/19 (markvdb@cs.vu.nl)
 * Reduce-button adapted to the new button actions.

2003/03/19 ({iversen, jurgenv}@cwi.nl)
 * added command add-pos-info to button-language.

   add-pos-info: Annotate parse-tree on stack with position info.

2003/03/18 ({iversen,markvdb}@cwi.nl
 * Added 2 new button actions.

2003/03/18 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Use shared-objects-config and aterm-java-config scripts to obtain last
   version of their jar files in configure.in

Mon Mar 17 14:18:19 CET 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * more aterm (jjtraveler) dependency issues fixed

2003/03/13 (vandenbr@loria.fr)
 * Introduced standalone editors for syntax, equations, and terms.
 * Introduced the notion of "application-status".
 * snd-msg(delete-editor(...)) replaced by snd-note(...).
 * Activation of term-editors explicitly acknownledged.

Tue Mar  4 09:51:15 CET 2003 <{markvdb,jong}@cwi.nl>
 * add new queries:
   - find Sdf definition of production used in Asf equation
   - find Sdf definition of variable used in Asf equation
   - find equation(s) that "implement" an Sdf production 

Thu Feb 27 09:24:54 CET 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * meta-studio: move NodeSizer.java from metastudio.graph to metastudio
   as it is not part of the generated graph package.
 * fix: profane usage of literal constants 0, 1, and 2 into symbolic
   constants (JOptionPane.YES_OPTION etc.) in handling of Dialogs.

Wed Feb 26 10:38:59 CET 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * MetaStudio.java: cleanup in file actions. Improved consistency,
   added missing default-properties, refactored fileBrowser code,
   introduced "refactor" popup submenu, and some misc. improvements.
 * edit-syntax.tb: remove set-focus that unconditionally tries to set
   the focus on the entire file. This interferes with tools (e.g. the
   query tool) that need to set the focus on a different portion of
   the term.
 * query-tool: some work done to simplify the findProduction code.
   Instead of two almost identical copies, we now have one iteration
   function which takes a predicate to do the actual (deep) comparison.
 * query-tool.tb: send query("FindProduction",..) not "FindSortDefinition"
   when asked to find a production.

Tue Feb 25 13:27:30 CET 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * refactoring: ApiGen generated sources only in metastudio.graph now

 * cleaned up tbscripts/Makefile.am

Wed Feb  5 13:30:47 CET 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * configure/automake stuff added for C implementation of query-tool
 * refactored query-tool directory structure into query-tool/src/{c,spec}/FILES
 * Refactoring:
   - query-tool.[ch] contains TB specifics
   - findSortDefinition.[ch] implements the one query we have so far
     (add more to QUERIES in Makefile.am as needed)
  By separating the queries from the TB related stuff we can now write
  (unit) tests for these queries, without having to invoke the MetaEnv.

2003/02/05 (markvdb@cs.vu.nl)
 * New message/function "close-module" which deals with "deleting"
   a module without removing from the imports in depending modules.

Wed Jan 29 10:15:44 CET 2003 <{jong,markvdb}@cwi.nl>
 * First "meta-query" experiment:
   given a focus in text-editor, find the "first" Module that has
   the focus-sort as rhs in a production

2003/01/28 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Release 0.12beta
 * The error message in the equation and syntax editor was
   lost due to a resetting of the focus.

Fri Jan 24 10:09:13 CET 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * add ${top_srcdir}/meta-studio to CLASSPATH during java compilation
   to satisfy distcheck needs

2003/01/23 <{jong,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
 * Release 0.11

 * Fixed bug in se.c: incorrect handling of amb() as parse tree.

2003/01/10 (markvdb@cwi.nl)

   a parameter which is also a parameter of the surrounding
   module, the renaming has to be renamed in a consistent
   way.

 * Return full imports when asking for the equations when dealing
   with renamings.

   not used by other modules will be closed in that case.

2002/10/11 (vinju@loria.fr)
 * Added functionality for non-existing modules in MetaStudio. If you click
   on them you can create them by choosing the option from the menu.
 * Fixed renaming of modules, old module was not removed
 * Fixed deleting of modules, module was not really deleted
 * Module that import a deleted module are now updated to not have the 
   import any more

 * Changed functionality concerning ambiguities in the editor. If you click 
   inside a cluster, the focus is set around the entire cluster 
   (to easily identify ambiguities).
 * Added Copy Module to Meta-Environment interface
 * Added Import Module to Meta-Environment interface

2002/10/09 (vinju@loria.fr)
 * Major refactoring of ToolBus scripts: 
     - All ASF specific scripts are removed and put into the asf package.
     - Toplevel meta script calls 'Meta-Interface' instead of all asf related
       processes
     - All asf related messages are replaced by generic 'hook' messages that 
       ALL must be implemented by the 'Meta-Interface' process. 
 * Added ability of setting a configuration option at runtime to MetaStudio
 * Added configuration option for term extension to MetaStudio
 * Graph-browser/MetaStudio are initialized with file extensions at run-time:
     - using the generic 'hook' messages

    - Takes additional -I options to extend the ToolBus include path
    - Can dump equations (-E) or a parsetable (-P) and save (-S) intermediate
      results
    - Contains no reference to ASF related tools anymore.
    - is called by a 'meta' script in the asf package which sets the correct
      -I paths.
 * dependencies on asf, asf-support and asc-support packages removed:
    - the asf package is now dependent on the meta package instead of vice
      versa.

 * Introduced the notion of "status-changed" in the editors
   to know that a term has become dirty.

2002/09/16 (vinju@loria.fr, vandenbr@loria.fr)
 * Code of in-output is made more robust.

2002/05/13 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Refactored implementation of module renaming.
 * Changed renaming widget to file browser in graphbrowser and metastudio.
 * Made renaming work with compound module names too.

2002/05/09 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)

   file name. The shortest possible module name is computed using the most
   specific path in the meta.conf file.
 * Error message if new module is not in subtree of meta.conf path.

2002/05/08 (markvdb@cwi.nl)

   so far).
 * Improved implementation of opening of modules and restoring 
   saved parse tables.
 * Improved behavior for handling modules that were edited outside of
   the Meta-Environment containing errors.
 * Changing the module name using the editor is handled like a parse error.
   I.o.w, it is not allowed. The rename module functionality should be used.

2002/05/07 (vandenbr@loria.fr) 
 * Improved button manipulation:
   - Check on top sort added.

2002/03/05 (jong@cwi.nl)
 * Refactored gvim-support. That is, I removed it alltogether from
   the meta package, and put it in its own package. This should

 * Improved the sdf-checker:
   - can deal with circular imports.
   - labels are checked.

  * relaxed the version checking of wish. If the script is unable to
    check the version of wish, it generates a warning banner. After that
    it assumes the right version is available in the environment.
  * changed the .eqs extension to .asf. The following extensions change:
      .eqs     -> .asf
      .asf.baf -> .eqs

2001/02/14 (jong@cwi.nl)
  * version 0.2
  * frozen release after internal CWI-repository move
  * this release is much smaller than previous releases because several
    components are now distributed separately:
    - sglr
    - pgen
    - asfix (is now split into pt-support, sdf-support, asf-support)
    - evaluator

     text-editors and ToolBus-processes are removed.

2000/7/5 (jong@cwi.nl)
  * Revamped editors' directory structure.
