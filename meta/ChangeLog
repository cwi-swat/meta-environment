 * Made the saving and reading of the term store a bit more verbose.

2003/07/07 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Bugfix: deleting an import that does not exist was lead to a deadlock
   because the io-tool returned an error that was not handled.

2003/07/03 (markvdb@cwi.nl)

 * Bumped to version 0.2 and release
 * "Save Module" is now "Dump Module". It writes the .sdf and .asf
   file by retrieving them from the store and overwriting the files on
   disk. It does not automagically also write the .trm.tbl file anymore,
   you can use the "Dump Parsetable" menu option for that.
 * Removed initialization of metastudio with extensions and library locations
 * Fixed a very strange bug: the type of updateList in the idef and the
   studio differed. Now reading in a string that is converted to an ATerm
   by calling factory.parse. 
 * Loading the term-store does not print error messages about existing tables 
   anymore.
   - If the user adds a table that already exists, the error message is
     still printed

 * Added a library for creating snapshots of the term-store

2003/06/27 ({jurgenv,markvdb}@cwi.nl)
 * When illegal modulenames are supplied by the '-m' option the 
   environment deals with it correctly now. Only the error messages
   are not printed because of parallel computation: the module are opened
   already while the MetaStudio is starting up.

2003/06/27 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * metastudio is able to deal with graphs with extra information.
 * First prototype of connection between parsetree and editor.

2003/06/26 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * The update-list takes a string as argument and not a term.
 * execute-action("unparsePT") is replaced by the button action unparse,
   this in order to be robust against ATBpack terms. The gen-adapter
   does not know how to handle these.

2003/06/25 (iversen@cwi.nl)
 * Improved the code in the TreeModel

2003/06/25 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * fixed a number of bugs in the refactoring facilities:
   - compound module names were not supported
   - the old path names were stored instead of the new ones
   - the new path name was used to delete obsolete files instead
     of the old path name
   - several inconsistencies where a complete filename was sent instead of
     a module name

2003/06/25 ({jurgenv,iversen}@cwi.nl)

Tue Jun  3 10:38:53 CEST 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * editors/manager/src/editor-manager.idef:
   - fix mismatch in # of params in result of get-editor-id()
 * tbscripts/file-creator.tb:
   - fix mismatch in # of params in create-new-module message
   - search for existing equations in a '.asf' file, not a '.sdf' file ;-)

2003/05/30 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * removed module-db subtree from configure.in, but still left it in the
   source tree.
 * made dump of parsetable and dump-equations use the same schema
 * fixed bugs in dump-equations 
 * extended term-store with 'get-values(table, keys)'.
 * changed get-all-sdf-definitions(Name) to reuse the import relation,
   then compute a transitive closure based on this simple relations,
   then only get the needed modules out of the store and create a definition
   from that.
 * get-depending-modules also reused the cached import relation now, such
   that no entire sdf-modules have to be transferred anymore just to throw
   away some parsetables.

2003/05/28 (markvdb@cs.vu.nl)
 * Added a number of "empty" assignments.
 * Replace the calculation of the import-graph by 
   a more direct derivation and display by meta-studio.
 * Editing of syntax modules with errors is enabled again.

2003/05/28 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * The meta-studio.idef subscribes to notes before executing the studio
   to prevent loosing any notes.

2003/05/27 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Term-store has two types of tables now: str and term. 
 * Pos-info is added up to depth 4 for equations as it used to  be,
   but the script now contains a magical value!
 * Factored out common functionality between all 'main' processes such
   as meta-studio, the standalone dumpers and the standalone editors
 * Renamed ToolBus files for the standalone tools! See asfsdf-meta/src for 
   examples on how to use them.
 * Reactivated invalidation of asf-trees and parsetables 
   (not working correctly yet)
 

2003/05/27 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Imports are filtered against the contents of the term-store.
 * meta.tb now has an explicit starting order of initial processes.
 * Some variables set to dummy values.
 * Some ATBpack and unpacks added.

2003/05/27 ({jong,jurgenv}@cwi.nl)
 * fixed a lot of stupid bugs in in-output (unneeded free calls for example)

2003/05/26 ({markvdb,jurgenv}@cwi.nl)
 * In-output idef messages are all prefix with "io-"
 * A path in the module name is always up to the module name, not
   even including a part of the compound module name
 * ...-named-... functions removed from in-output because there are
   now only two representations of a filename:
     1. A full absolute filename including path and extension
     2. [Path,Name,Extension] where the concatenation should form
        a path of type 1. Name can contain directory separators.
 * Editor-manager takes a name of type 1 and does not concatenate
   extensions anymore
 * All tools and processes adapted to use the new filename conventions
 * Posinfo is now added with the correct full filenames (style 1) again

2003/05/21 ({markvdb,jurgenv}@cwi.nl)
 * The coordination part of the old module-db is now implemented
   in ToolBus scripts.
 * Module renaming is now implemented in the sdf-support package, not
   in module-db and asf-operations, or elan-operations any more. The
   tool is called sdf-renaming. It takes a module and the current import
   relation and returns a list of modules that are copies of the original
   module with the appropriate renamings applied.
 * Deactivated the module-db subtree in this package. It will remain here
   for a while to do some browsing, but it is now officially dead code.
 * The hook message postprocess-collected-semantics-hook-result has
   been changed to take a <str> for a module name instead of a <term>.
   Note: asfsdf-meta and elan-env should deal with this change.

Fri May 23 09:40:00 CEST 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * tbscripts/meta.tb: add #ifdef around #include of query-tool.idef
 * src/generic-meta.sh.src: add -I<path> to meta-query tool

2003/05/21 ({markvdb,jurgenv}@cwi.nl)
 * working towards implementing the module-db coordination tasks in ToolBus
   in tbscripts/module-db.tb
 * term-store now has terms as values, not lists anymore

   the get-root button action now first pops the current module name from
   the stack.

2003/05/20 ({jurgenv,jong}@cwi.nl)
 * added a number of new functions to the in-output tool:
   - find-file: searches a file in a given number of paths
   - compare-files: checks if filenames point to the same file on the system
   - get-filename: construct filename from dir+name+ext
 * renamed some functions in the in-output tool
 * split parsing, conversion to absolute paths and registering of the
   meta.conf file

Tue May 13 13:16:20 CEST 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * fix tbscripts/editors.tb and editors/text/text-editor.idef: 
   process TextEditor no longer has any parameters, making it abide
   by our coding standard for the idef of a tool. Instead the parameters
   are passed by a message: edit-text(EditorId, FileName, ButtonList)

Mon May 12 14:13:14 CEST 2003 ({jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl)
 * Fixed bug: LAYOUT-GRAPH process was only started #if METASTUDIO was
   defined, but this #define had been deemed "dead code" earlier

2003/05/10 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)

  * First steps of the restructuring of the "module-db".

2003/05/07 (markvdb@cs.vu.nl)
 * Fixed the annoying behaviour of closing and opening the
   term editor in the demos of Jorgen Iversen and Paul Klint.

2003/04/25 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Deadlock problems caused by dissappearing text editors partially solved by 
   changing the idef of text-editor to use only notes.
 * Processes that send messages to editors made more robust against 
   non-existing editors, or they now listen to notes that declare an
   editor dead.
 * This solved the memory leak introduced by a workaround for the
   previous problem that lead to eternally waiting Text-Editor processes.
 * Replaced assert statements in structure editor by proper handling
   of non-existing editors. 
 * Replaced some assert statements in editor-manager too.
 * All buttons in editors are now handled via the button-language.
   The text-editor knows nothing about the details of buttons anymore.
 * Button names are now list of strings. For example: ["Action","Parse"].
   This will add the "Parse" button to the menu "Action".
   Note that all button scripts will have to be adapted to deal with this.
 * The button language was changed. All actions that had a modulename
   as a direct argument now read it from the stack as a string.
 * Added a new primitive to the button language: 'push-modulename' that
   pushed the modulename of the current editor onto the stack
 * The standard Meta-Environment buttons are now completely externalized
   from the configuration-manager. A file called 'standard.buttons' is
   installed and the configuration-manager reads it in when the 
   Meta-Environment starts up.
 * Used ApiGen to reimplement configuration manager

2003/04/25 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Refactored button-actions to use StackPush/Pop operations
 * Fixed a bug in the structure editor, ViewTree on the root of a term
   caused a core dump.
 * Completely refactored editor managing scripts. All code duplication
   removed. Editor killing simplified (must be tested thoroughly!)

2003/04/24 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * All scripts related to the implementation of the button language
   are now located in a single button-actions.tb script. This script needs
   more refactoring

2003/04/24 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * ViewTree added and Meta-Environment renamed to Term-Actions.

2003/04/16 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Reintroduced the save and print entries in the module menu.

2003/04/15 (markvdb@cs.vu.nl)
 * Repaired a very annoying bug wrt setting of foci. The message
   move-focus-to-root responded with "set-focus" which causes
   quite some interference.

2003/03/30 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Used backquotes to delay calling *-config scripts to after
   configure phase. Otherwise autobundle can't configure all packages
   before building them.

2003/03/28 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added dependency on new graph-support package
 * Added capability of drawing diamonds and ellipses to MetaStudio graph
   panels

2003/03/25 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Restructured the killing of editors, a new process introduced.
   A number of small bugs are solved in this way. There is still
   one major issue with respect reusing an existing term-editor.

2003/03/24 ({markvdb, iversen}@cwi.nl)
 * Added button-action show-area, which takes a modulename as 
   argument and an 
  aterm containing position info from the stack, and then highlights the 
  position, using the module to parse the file containing the position. 

* Also added position-info annotation to all terms.

* Removed button-action add-pos-info.

2003/03/20 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Added a "Delete this module" for a non-existing module, this
   omission was reported by PDM.

2003/03/20 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Removed dependency on shared-objects and jjtraveler. This is taken care
   of by aterm-java-config from now on.

2003/03/19 (markvdb@cs.vu.nl)
 * Reduce-button adapted to the new button actions.

2003/03/19 ({iversen, jurgenv}@cwi.nl)
 * added command add-pos-info to button-language.

   add-pos-info: Annotate parse-tree on stack with position info.

2003/03/18 ({iversen,markvdb}@cwi.nl
 * Added 2 new button actions.

2003/03/18 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Use shared-objects-config and aterm-java-config scripts to obtain last
   version of their jar files in configure.in

Mon Mar 17 14:18:19 CET 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * more aterm (jjtraveler) dependency issues fixed

2003/03/13 (vandenbr@loria.fr)
 * Introduced standalone editors for syntax, equations, and terms.

 * Activation of term-editors explicitly acknownledged.

Tue Mar  4 09:51:15 CET 2003 <{markvdb,jong}@cwi.nl>
 * add new queries:
   - find Sdf definition of production used in Asf equation
   - find Sdf definition of variable used in Asf equation
   - find equation(s) that "implement" an Sdf production 

Thu Feb 27 09:24:54 CET 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * meta-studio: move NodeSizer.java from metastudio.graph to metastudio
   as it is not part of the generated graph package.
 * fix: profane usage of literal constants 0, 1, and 2 into symbolic
   constants (JOptionPane.YES_OPTION etc.) in handling of Dialogs.

Wed Feb 26 10:38:59 CET 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * MetaStudio.java: cleanup in file actions. Improved consistency,
   added missing default-properties, refactored fileBrowser code,
   introduced "refactor" popup submenu, and some misc. improvements.
 * edit-syntax.tb: remove set-focus that unconditionally tries to set
   the focus on the entire file. This interferes with tools (e.g. the
   query tool) that need to set the focus on a different portion of
   the term.
 * query-tool: some work done to simplify the findProduction code.
   Instead of two almost identical copies, we now have one iteration
   function which takes a predicate to do the actual (deep) comparison.
 * query-tool.tb: send query("FindProduction",..) not "FindSortDefinition"
   when asked to find a production.

Tue Feb 25 13:27:30 CET 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * refactoring: ApiGen generated sources only in metastudio.graph now

Wed Feb  5 13:30:47 CET 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * configure/automake stuff added for C implementation of query-tool
 * refactored query-tool directory structure into query-tool/src/{c,spec}/FILES
 * Refactoring:
   - query-tool.[ch] contains TB specifics
   - findSortDefinition.[ch] implements the one query we have so far
     (add more to QUERIES in Makefile.am as needed)
  By separating the queries from the TB related stuff we can now write
  (unit) tests for these queries, without having to invoke the MetaEnv.

2003/02/05 (markvdb@cs.vu.nl)
 * New message/function "close-module" which deals with "deleting"
   a module without removing from the imports in depending modules.

Wed Jan 29 10:15:44 CET 2003 <{jong,markvdb}@cwi.nl>
 * First "meta-query" experiment:
   given a focus in text-editor, find the "first" Module that has
   the focus-sort as rhs in a production

2003/01/28 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Release 0.12beta

   to satisfy distcheck needs

2003/01/23 <{jong,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
 * Release 0.11

 * Fixed bug in se.c: incorrect handling of amb() as parse tree.

2003/01/10 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Fixed a bug with renamings. If an imported module has
   a parameter which is also a parameter of the surrounding
   module, the renaming has to be renamed in a consistent
   way.
 * Fixed a number of error messages.

2003/01/08 (markvdb@cs.vu.nl)
 * Return full imports when asking for the equations when dealing
   with renamings.

 * Removed dead code.
 * Fixed a deadlock when copying and pasting.

2002/11/15 (vandenbr@loria.fr)

   are needed both by meta as well as eqs-dump.

2002/11/15 (markvdb@cs.vu.nl)
 * Restructuring of the scripts with respect to setting of parse tables,
   calling of sglr, processing of parse tree cq parse errors.

   not used by other modules will be closed in that case.

2002/10/11 (vinju@loria.fr)
 * Added functionality for non-existing modules in MetaStudio. If you click
   on them you can create them by choosing the option from the menu.
 * Fixed renaming of modules, old module was not removed
 * Fixed deleting of modules, module was not really deleted
 * Module that import a deleted module are now updated to not have the 
   import any more

   inside a cluster, the focus is set around the entire cluster 
   (to easily identify ambiguities).
 * Added Copy Module to Meta-Environment interface
 * Added Import Module to Meta-Environment interface

2002/10/09 (vinju@loria.fr)
 * Major refactoring of ToolBus scripts: 
     - All ASF specific scripts are removed and put into the asf package.
     - Toplevel meta script calls 'Meta-Interface' instead of all asf related
       processes
     - All asf related messages are replaced by generic 'hook' messages that 
       ALL must be implemented by the 'Meta-Interface' process. 
 * Added ability of setting a configuration option at runtime to MetaStudio
 * Added configuration option for term extension to MetaStudio
 * Graph-browser/MetaStudio are initialized with file extensions at run-time:
     - using the generic 'hook' messages

   a single script called 'generic-meta'. Generic-meta:
    - Takes additional -I options to extend the ToolBus include path
    - Can dump equations (-E) or a parsetable (-P) and save (-S) intermediate
      results
    - Contains no reference to ASF related tools anymore.
    - is called by a 'meta' script in the asf package which sets the correct
      -I paths.
 * dependencies on asf, asf-support and asc-support packages removed:
    - the asf package is now dependent on the meta package instead of vice
      versa.

   saved parse tables.
 * Improved behavior for handling modules that were edited outside of
   the Meta-Environment containing errors.
 * Changing the module name using the editor is handled like a parse error.
   I.o.w, it is not allowed. The rename module functionality should be used.

   to run a fixed compiled specification. 

2002/04/18 (vandenbr@loria.fr)
 * Variables are visualized with "*variable*" again, this bug

 * in editors/structure, renamed Editor.[ch] to EditorData.[ch] to
   avoid conflicts on filename-case-insensitive platforms.

2002/03/05 (jong@cwi.nl)
 * Refactored gvim-support. That is, I removed it alltogether from
   the meta package, and put it in its own package. This should
   fix the libtool problems until the next person decides to use
   a dynamic library :)

 * Added support for lexical variables in sdf-checker

2002/01/03 ({jong,jurgenv}@cwi.nl)

 * Fixed a bug. Closing unparsed equations resulted in module-db inconsistency.
 * And the same bug fixed for unparsed syntax definitions.
 * Another bug fixed, deadlock occurred when dumping equations over incomplete
   specifications

2001/05/14 ({jong,markvdb}@cwi.nl)
 * restructured {in-output,module-db.tbscripts} so that asf-sections,
   .sdf.baf, .asf.baf, and parsetables are now read/looked up/written

  * relaxed the version checking of wish. If the script is unable to
    check the version of wish, it generates a warning banner. After that
    it assumes the right version is available in the environment.
  * changed the .eqs extension to .asf. The following extensions change:
      .eqs     -> .asf
      .asf.baf -> .eqs
      .eqs.baf -> .asf.baf
      .eqs.tbl -> .asf.tbl

2001/02/14 (jong@cwi.nl)
  * version 0.2
  * frozen release after internal CWI-repository move
  * this release is much smaller than previous releases because several
    components are now distributed separately:
    - sglr
    - pgen
    - asfix (is now split into pt-support, sdf-support, asf-support)
    - evaluator

     text-editors and ToolBus-processes are removed.

2000/7/5 (jong@cwi.nl)
  * Revamped editors' directory structure.
