Tue Mar  1 14:07:44 CET 2005 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Syntax highlighting improved. There are now three levels, in increasing
   priority:
	* default level: categorizes sub-tree into a few classes: MetaKeyword,
	  MetaAmbiguity, MetaVariable
	* production level: the user can annotate a production with the
	  category(<str>) attribute. A number of predefined categories exist
	  for the users convenience, but new ones can be added. Currently
	  we have: Comment, Constant, Variable, Identifier, Type, and Todo.
	* annotation level: the user can annotate a parse tree with an
	  annotation having the "category" label. For example using the
	  set-term-anno builtin in ASF. For this purpose we have predefined
	  the categories: Error, Warning, Info and Fatal (parallel to the
	  Error data-structure). Again, the user might add his own categories
	  by editing his meta.properties file.

   and retrieving of specification/equations/tests.

Thu Apr 15 14:16:19 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Added concept of ValueChangedListener to UserInterfacePanels. This
   can be used to let other components change their behaviour when the contents
   of any UserInterfacePanel changes. The first usage is to make Tabs visible
   when a ZoomableGraphPanel is updated with a new graph 

Thu Apr 15 10:31:44 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>

   instead of revealing MetaEnv's bowels to user-interface.idef

Fri Apr  2 15:14:06 CEST 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * again more work done on the script-refactoring.
   at least "reduce term" is still broken.

   - cleanup of the various escapeXYZ() functions
   - remove arcane invocation of  in "gvim --remote-send" 
 * meta-studio/metastudio/MultiBridge.java

     parameterwise: both take an ATerm (the Summary).
 * tbscripts/{feedback,parse-utils}.tb:
   - Summary instead of deprecated Feedback notation
   - Disect a Summary locally instead of complex shortcut implementation
     in error-support library.
   - revamped PrepareParseErrorForEditor in various smaller pieces

Tue Mar 16  CET 2004 <iversen@cwi.nl>

   add-initial-syntax-modules-hook, clear-module-db-hook, 
   other-top-sort-hook.
	
Thu Mar 11 16:17:53 CET 2004 <markvdb@cwi.nl>

   - Unnecessary messages suppressed.
   - Upgrading of equations always parses before upgrading
   - Reducing an erroneous term not longer generates a vague message.
   - Improved some issues wrt the term-store.

   Popup menus are triggered differently
   on different systems. Therefore, isPopupTrigger should be checked
   in both mousePressed and mouseReleased for proper cross-platform
   functionality.


Thu Mar  4 13:30:18 CET 2004 <iversen,jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Fixed a bug: Parse-Syntax was called with wrong argument order 
   (everything is a term). Probably loading a term-store always failed
   to see that nothing changed due to this.

Wed Mar  3 11:37:44 CET 2004 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * tbscripts/button-actions.tb:
   - To be solved: te-set-cursor-at-focus call changed to printf of call

 * added new action; convert-feedback to fo from an error produced
   by an ASF+SDF specification to an error that can be handled by
   the MetaStudio.

Tue Feb 17 15:21:17 CET 2004 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * meta-studio/metastudio/components/graph/GraphPanel.java:
   - getZoomToFitFactor checks graph on null 
   - add DEFAULT_ZOOM_FACTOR = 100 to scale to 100% by default

Tue Feb 17 11:01:31 CET 2004 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * editors/text/emacs/{connector.c,gnu-emacs.el}:
   - explicit synchronization with hive during writing of contents
     fixes anomalities during "autosave".
 * editors/text/gvim/{connector.c,meta.vim.src}:
   - explicit synchronization with hive during writing of contents
     fixes anomalities during "autosave".
   - refactor several reusable pieces of vim script into functions.
 * editors/text/{common,emax,gvim}/connector.[ch]:
   - refactored "getContents" into the common core. Both editors now
   really use the *same* code to read the contents of the file.
   - refactored "protocol_expect" from gvim to common core + rename
   to protocolExpect.

Mon Feb 16 15:07:46 CET 2004 <{jong,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
 * tbscripts/feedback.tb: refactored and reimplemented (in error-support)
   the ShowXXX functions
 * editors/text/*:
   - remove double functionality to go to a specific offset in
     a file, "goto-cursor-at-offset" is the only one left.
 * editors: text vs. structure
   - fix bug where text- and structure editor were out of sync,
     causing (a.o.) the "annoying emacs *beep* bug".
 * editors/text/xemacs: removed

2004/02/16 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * The asfsdfchecker is now only called in case a parsetable
   has to be generated for parsing terms and equations in 
   editors. When dumping equations, the parsetable is only
   generated for the top module.
- The DeleteEditors has been duplicated and the new process
  is more subtile wrt closing of editors. This new process
  is used in reverting modules, adding and removing imports.

Fri Feb 13 15:20:49 CET 2004 <{kooiker,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
 * Replaced ptpretty by pandora functionality
 * Warning: pandora is out of the box!
 * The pretty-print button now replaces the current text instead
   of spawning a new editor.
 * Warning: pretty-printing can not be 'undone' using the editors
   undo buffer.
 * Replaced ptpretty dependency by pandora package dependency

Thu Feb 12 13:38:55 CET 2004 <{jong,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
 * prefixed all in/outgoing structure editor messages with "se-"
 * prefixed all in/outgoing text editor messages with "te-"

Tue Feb 10 17:49:38 CET 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * in-output and term-store tools run a garbage collect after 
   every event using -TB_COLLECT_LOOP 1 in their tool definition.

Tue Feb 10 14:55:38 CET 2004 <m336@cwi.nl>
 * upgrade auto* to: autoconf 2.59, automake 1.7.9, libtool 1.5.2

Mon Feb  9 14:59:39 CET 2004 <{jong,kooiker,vinju}@cwi.nl>
 * version bump to 1.3 (toolbus interface changed + several bugfixes)
 * in-output/src/main.c:remove_file:
   - change remove() into unlink() as remove() also removes directories
 * in-output/src/main.c:decons_filename:
   - fix illegal memory overwrite which horked an existing AFun,
     causing the ATerm GC to break down.
 * term-store/*.c: all char* pointers in ToolBus API changed to const char*
 * in-output/src/main.c:get_filename:
   - and another ... which we now found because all ToolBus functions
     that manipulate "char *' are now const.

Mon Feb  2 16:43:59 CET 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * fix Makefile.am to get "distcheck" working

2004/01/30 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Compliant with automake-1.6
 * Using libtoolize instead of our own fixes to get libtool working

2004/01/28 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * renamed display-feedback-summary to show-feedback-summary.

Tue Jan 27 16:17:47 CET 2004 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * text/editor-hive.c:
   invoke "write-contents" before all "get-focus-text" calls, so buffer
   is automagically written just in time.
 * text/editor-hive.c, text/{common,emacs,gvim}/...
   add support for autosave: we can now ask gvim+emacs to "write-contents"

2004/01/26 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * fixed recursive closing of modules. Circular imports can be closed now
   using "Recursive closing". A more complex analysis was needed to detect
   if a module can be closed. Solution:
    1: get all transitive imports for the top module that is to be closed
    2: for all transitive imports, remove all modules from this list that
       are used by modules that are not in the transitive imports list.
    3: all remaining modules in the list can be closed then
    4: if the top module was closed, the operation was successfull,
       if not, the operation returns an error message.

2004/01/26 (markvdb@cw.nl)
 * Fixed a hairy bug wrt generation of parse tables for modules with
   syntax errors.

Mon Jan 26 11:17:58 CET 2004 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * editors/text/common/Makefile.am:
   removed hardwired path /home/markvdb/sdf-apigen/bin/adt-to-c
 * meta.pkg:
   upgrade dependency on graph-support to 0.2
   upgrade dependency on asc-support to 1.8

2004/01/20 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * First version of clickable parse errors.

2004/01/13 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Add and remove imports choose from a list of available names instead 
   of a file selector.
   
2004/01/12 ({markvdb,jurgenv}@cwi.nl)
 * Reimplemented module status panel to a tree
 * Introduced the new error handling functionality
 
2004/01/06 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Simplified the TB interface of SGLR. A parse request contains
   directly the parse table.
 * The entire functionality of setting parse tables has disappeared.

2003/12/23 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Basic functionality for dealing with the Feedback messages added.
 * Known problems: the errorapi does not know the language of the file
   that the error occurred in. That means that an editor is opened over
   the "unknown language" with obvious disadvantages
   

2003/12/19 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * MetaStudio revised towards an object oriented design:
 	- module browsing components (tree, graph and module stats) grouped into
 	  one single Tab.
 	- module status redesigned. Contains now: the selected module name, an
 	  imports menu and an imported by menu.
 	- graph panels have an individual zooming capacity using a slidebar.
 	- zooming keeps the current selected node always in view
 	- zooming below 100% introduces Tooltips over hovered nodes
 	- refactored MetaStudio to extract GUI components into classes:
 	  HistoryPanel, StatusBar, etc.
 	- added a new component: FeedbackList for dealing with the new error api.
 	- added a dependency on the error-support package
 	- introduced ToolComponent, a JPanel that can act as a ToolBus tool. 
 	  It implements the complete UserInterfaceTif interface to do that. 
 	  All (most) components of the MetaStudio should extend this abstract class.
 	- introduced a package hierarchy below metastudio: "components" for GUI
 	  components, "data" for data representation.
    - ModuleBrowser is now a separate component that can be reused and run
      in multiple instances in a single MetaStudio.
    - Improved efficiency of graph layout (FromTerm was executed twice!)
 	
Mon Dec  8 14:12:18 CET 2003 <{jong,jurgenv,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * editors/text/gvim/{connector.c,meta.vim.src}:
   - explicitly synchronise gvim-connector and gvim instance between
     each AddMenu call.
   - repaint (cleanup) gvim once after *all* menu entries have been
     i.s.o. in between each AddMenu call.

2003/12/08 <markvdb@cwi.nl>
 * Fixed a bug when the specification is incomplete wrt
   parsed equations.

    a non-existing term store, this fixes bug #70.

Thu Oct  9 14:11:48 CEST 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * editors/text/gvim:
   - install meta.vim in pkgdata-dir: install/share/meta/meta.vim and read
     it from that location. Closes: #18
   - split handshaking protocol into two fases:
     1. assert that gvim has connected to the connector;
     2. assert that gvim has read the installed meta.vim file.

Wed Oct  8 16:21:16 CEST 2003 <{jong,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
 * regenerated Java Graph API:
   - why is this (still?) in Meta Studio anyway and not in graph-support?
 * add support for border-color and background-color based on graph
   attributes.

Wed Oct  8 13:27:47 CEST 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * editors/text/emacs/connector.c:

 * editors/text/common/*dict.[ch]:
   - re-generated after fix in aterm/dicttoc tool to fix gcc-3.3.1 warnings

2003/10/06 <markvdb@cwi.nl>
 * check-sort("SORTNAME") changed into
   push-string("SORTNAME"),check-sort
   Furthermore, check-sort leaves a true or false on the stack
   depending on whether it was successful or not.
 * Adapted the actionchecker accordingly.

Tue Sep 30 10:18:45 CEST 2003 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * editors/text/emacs/connector.c: change function escapeQuotes to also
   escape escape-characters. Closes: #48
 * ./reconf: first remove generated ./libtool, so it will not be found
   as "the" libtool when subsequently trying to find the system libtool

   error in a SDF module outside the Meta-Environment and
   there is a valid term-store.

2003/09/24 <markvdb@cwi.nl>
 * First version of a script to check action scripts.

2003/09/22 <markvdb@cwi.nl>
 * in io_find_file the found files should be reported in order of
   the search paths as it used to be. Otherwise the library will get
   precedence over user-defined modules which is unwanted behaviour.

2003/09/22 <markvdb@cwi.nl>
 * First version of action/button script checker.

2003/09/18 <markvdb@cwi.nl>

 * io-tool and configuration-manager idefs now start the managing process
   themselves

Mon Sep  8 14:04:42 CEST 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * editors/text/common/connector.c:

   - need '=' instead of '==' for pure POSIX comparison of strings for sh

Wed Aug 20 14:53:08 CEST 2003 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * editors/structure/src/EditorData.adt:
   change alternative Path/term -> Path/tree

2003/08/19 ({jurgenv,jong}@cwi.nl)

Thu Jul 31 12:55:42 CEST 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * version bumped into 1.1
 * configmanager.idef:
   - renamed ProcessButtons into AddUserDefinedActions
   - renamed ProcessStandardButtons into AddPreDefinedActions
   - renamed "process-button-file" into "set-actions", making it
     a procedure (snd-do) iso a function (snd-eval) since it never
     returned anything useful anyway.
   - added "remove-actions" to configuration manager, instead of
     feeding it a fake, empty actions file to remove actions.
 * configmanager.c: 
   - implemented the above interface definition changes.

2003/07/31 ({markvdb,jurgenv}@cwi.nl)
 * Released version 1.0

2003/07/30 (markvdb@cs.vu.nl)
 * Removed a hard-coded path in the in-output tool.

2003/07/29 (markvdb@cwi.nl)

 * images/*gif restored and renamed
 * improved buttons-adt and update several files to reflect new API
 * restored toolbar functionality
 * changed some warnings/errors in term-store

2003/07/09 (markvdb@cs.vu.nl)
 * Introduced the button actions "pack-tree" and "unpack-tree".
 * Made the saving and reading of the term store a bit more verbose.

2003/07/07 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Bugfix: deleting an import that does not exist was lead to a deadlock
   because the io-tool returned an error that was not handled.

2003/07/03 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Reorganized the show-list and show-area in such a way that
   the show-area does no longer be parameterized with a module name.
 * The "ShowSource" button is added to the standard buttons.
 * Renamed and removed some variables.
 * Introduced a packed write and read function in in-output,
   adapted the reading and writing of the term store.

2003/07/02 (markvdb@cs.vu.nl)
 * The type (trm/eqs) is now made explicit.
 * Introduced a new button to dump the parse table of the equations.
 * Removed the save-module button.
 * Renamed the save-all button to "save term store".

   the "stand-alone" scripts.


2003/07/02 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Bumped to version 0.2 and release
 * "Save Module" is now "Dump Module". It writes the .sdf and .asf
   file by retrieving them from the store and overwriting the files on
   disk. It does not automagically also write the .trm.tbl file anymore,
   you can use the "Dump Parsetable" menu option for that.
 * Removed initialization of metastudio with extensions and library locations
 * Fixed a very strange bug: the type of updateList in the idef and the
   studio differed. Now reading in a string that is converted to an ATerm
   by calling factory.parse. 
 * Loading the term-store does not print error messages about existing tables 
   anymore.
   - If the user adds a table that already exists, the error message is
     still printed
   - An error message is printed in all cases where a table is added with
     the same name as an existing table, but a different type
 * Commented out icons in MetaStudio
 * Moved scale menu to file menubar

2003/07/01 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * First version of the reading and writing of the snapshot
   of the term-store.

2003/07/01 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added ATBpack to get-parsetree of structure editor
 * Get all equations does not use all sdf modules anymore, only those
   imported by the module that the equations are requested for.

2003/06/27 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added a library for creating snapshots of the term-store

2003/06/27 ({jurgenv,markvdb}@cwi.nl)
 * When illegal modulenames are supplied by the '-m' option the 
   environment deals with it correctly now. Only the error messages
   are not printed because of parallel computation: the module are opened
   already while the MetaStudio is starting up.

2003/06/27 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * metastudio is able to deal with graphs with extra information.
 * First prototype of connection between parsetree and editor.

2003/06/26 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added package definition file

2003/06/26 (iversen@cwi.nl)
 * Added some type parameters to processes in module database
 * Introduced hook to do something before collecting sdf2 definitions

2003/06/26 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * The update-list takes a string as argument and not a term.
 * execute-action("unparsePT") is replaced by the button action unparse,
   this in order to be robust against ATBpack terms. The gen-adapter
   does not know how to handle these.

2003/06/25 (iversen@cwi.nl)
 * Improved the code in the TreeModel

2003/06/25 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * fixed a number of bugs in the refactoring facilities:
   - compound module names were not supported
   - the old path names were stored instead of the new ones
   - the new path name was used to delete obsolete files instead
     of the old path name
   - several inconsistencies where a complete filename was sent instead of
     a module name

 * made menuitems in MetaStudio configurable with button-scripts.
 * added some new button actions to support this.
 * added MetaStudio menuitems to standard.buttons.

2003/06/03 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * First refactoring operation (add-import) enabled.

Tue Jun  3 10:38:53 CEST 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * editors/manager/src/editor-manager.idef:
   - fix mismatch in # of params in result of get-editor-id()
 * tbscripts/file-creator.tb:
   - fix mismatch in # of params in create-new-module message
   - search for existing equations in a '.asf' file, not a '.sdf' file ;-)

2003/05/30 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * removed module-db subtree from configure.in, but still left it in the
   source tree.
 * made dump of parsetable and dump-equations use the same schema
 * fixed bugs in dump-equations 
 * extended term-store with 'get-values(table, keys)'.
 * changed get-all-sdf-definitions(Name) to reuse the import relation,
   then compute a transitive closure based on this simple relations,
   then only get the needed modules out of the store and create a definition
   from that.
 * get-depending-modules also reused the cached import relation now, such
   that no entire sdf-modules have to be transferred anymore just to throw
   away some parsetables.

2003/05/28 (markvdb@cs.vu.nl)
 * Added a number of "empty" assignments.
 * Replace the calculation of the import-graph by 
   a more direct derivation and display by meta-studio.
 * Editing of syntax modules with errors is enabled again.

2003/05/28 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * The meta-studio.idef subscribes to notes before executing the studio
   to prevent loosing any notes.

2003/05/27 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Term-store has two types of tables now: str and term. 
 * Pos-info is added up to depth 4 for equations as it used to  be,
   but the script now contains a magical value!
 * Factored out common functionality between all 'main' processes such
   as meta-studio, the standalone dumpers and the standalone editors
 * Renamed ToolBus files for the standalone tools! See asfsdf-meta/src for 
   examples on how to use them.
 * Reactivated invalidation of asf-trees and parsetables 
   (not working correctly yet)
 

2003/05/27 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Imports are filtered against the contents of the term-store.
 * meta.tb now has an explicit starting order of initial processes.
 * Some variables set to dummy values.
 * Some ATBpack and unpacks added.

2003/05/27 ({jong,jurgenv}@cwi.nl)
 * fixed a lot of stupid bugs in in-output (unneeded free calls for example)

2003/05/26 ({markvdb,jurgenv}@cwi.nl)
 * In-output idef messages are all prefix with "io-"
 * A path in the module name is always up to the module name, not
   even including a part of the compound module name
 * ...-named-... functions removed from in-output because there are
   now only two representations of a filename:
     1. A full absolute filename including path and extension
     2. [Path,Name,Extension] where the concatenation should form
        a path of type 1. Name can contain directory separators.
 * Editor-manager takes a name of type 1 and does not concatenate
   extensions anymore
 * All tools and processes adapted to use the new filename conventions
 * Posinfo is now added with the correct full filenames (style 1) again

2003/05/21 ({markvdb,jurgenv}@cwi.nl)
 * The coordination part of the old module-db is now implemented
   in ToolBus scripts.
 * Module renaming is now implemented in the sdf-support package, not
   in module-db and asf-operations, or elan-operations any more. The
   tool is called sdf-renaming. It takes a module and the current import
   relation and returns a list of modules that are copies of the original
   module with the appropriate renamings applied.
 * Deactivated the module-db subtree in this package. It will remain here
   for a while to do some browsing, but it is now officially dead code.
 * The hook message postprocess-collected-semantics-hook-result has
   been changed to take a <str> for a module name instead of a <term>.
   Note: asfsdf-meta and elan-env should deal with this change.

Fri May 23 09:40:00 CEST 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * tbscripts/meta.tb: add #ifdef around #include of query-tool.idef
 * src/generic-meta.sh.src: add -I<path> to meta-query tool

Thu May 22 14:42:02 CEST 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * query-tool/**: move to a separate package "meta-query"
 * tbscripts/button-actions.tb: add support for queries
 * tbscripts/query.tb: cleanup (delete) standalone/ui stuff
 * tbscripts/meta.tb: Query processes conditional in toolbus() call
 * src/generic-meta.sh.src: add -q flag to enable query support

2003/05/21 ({markvdb,jurgenv}@cwi.nl)
 * working towards implementing the module-db coordination tasks in ToolBus
   in tbscripts/module-db.tb
 * term-store now has terms as values, not lists anymore
 * all files in module-db/src are now deprecated, do not edit there anymore.

Wed May 21 13:15:45 CEST 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * Added -Werror in in-output and module-db Makefiles.
 * Fixed multiline string-constanct in ATmake construct in module-db/main.c
 * Removed deprecated functionality in in-output/main.c

2003/05/21 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Editing of erroneous syntax modules enabled.

2003/05/20 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * To fix the immediate reduce (without first pressing 'Parse') bug,
   the get-root button action now first pops the current module name from
   the stack.

2003/05/20 ({jurgenv,jong}@cwi.nl)
 * added a number of new functions to the in-output tool:
   - find-file: searches a file in a given number of paths
   - compare-files: checks if filenames point to the same file on the system
   - get-filename: construct filename from dir+name+ext
 * renamed some functions in the in-output tool
 * split parsing, conversion to absolute paths and registering of the
   meta.conf file
 * dialog with io tool extended
 * brought scripts up-to-date with changes in in-output and configuration-
   manager

2003/05/19 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Moved term-store tool to toplevel
 * Copied sdf specific functionality from module-db to sdf-modules tool
   located in the sdf-support package.
 * Partly reimplemented module-db in a ToolBus script that uses only
   the sdf-modules.idef and term-store.idef

2003/05/19 ({jong,markvdb}@cwi.nl)   
 * Added explicit ATBpack and ATBunpack.   
 * Introduced write-term-file.
 * Removed configuration specific stuff from IO.

2003/05/16 ({jurgenv,markvdb}@cwi.nl)
 * Major revision of UI, IO, MDB.
 * NOT YET FINISHED, SO DO NOT UPDATE!

2003/05/15 ({jurgenv,markvdb}@cwi.nl)
 * Created a generic term-store tool
 * Some features are turned off for the moment (module refactorings)

2003/05/14 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Intermediate version of new module-db.

Tue May 13 13:16:20 CEST 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * fix tbscripts/editors.tb and editors/text/text-editor.idef: 
   process TextEditor no longer has any parameters, making it abide
   by our coding standard for the idef of a tool. Instead the parameters
   are passed by a message: edit-text(EditorId, FileName, ButtonList)

Mon May 12 14:13:14 CEST 2003 ({jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl)
 * Fixed bug: LAYOUT-GRAPH process was only started #if METASTUDIO was
   defined, but this #define had been deemed "dead code" earlier

2003/05/10 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Removed dead code taking care of switching between graphbrowser
   and metastudio.

Fri May  9 11:10:03 CEST 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * Add "Clear History" functionalty to MetaStudio, clearing the bottom
   right message pane.
 * Fix indentation level of this ChangeLog which managed to sneak to a
   deeper level again, and since everybody copies the previous one...

2003/05/09 ({markvdb,jurgenv}@cwi.nl)
  * First steps of the restructuring of the "module-db".

2003/05/07 (markvdb@cs.vu.nl)
 * Fixed the annoying behaviour of closing and opening the
   term editor in the demos of Jorgen Iversen and Paul Klint.
   A new button action `close-editor' has been introduced.

2003/04/29 ({iversen,jurgenv}@cwi.nl)
 * Added a new widget to the MetaStudio: a message list
 * Fixed a number of typos and wrong messages in the ToolBus scripts
   that were introduced recently by jurgenv.
 * Added a new type of 'editor' to the button language: message-list.

2003/04/28 (markvdb@cs.vu.nl)
 * Clean up the new button language a bit.
 * Tested it on the boolean transformations.
 * Given some button actions more appropriate names.

2003/04/25 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Deadlock problems caused by dissappearing text editors partially solved by 
   changing the idef of text-editor to use only notes.
 * Processes that send messages to editors made more robust against 
   non-existing editors, or they now listen to notes that declare an
   editor dead.
 * This solved the memory leak introduced by a workaround for the
   previous problem that lead to eternally waiting Text-Editor processes.
 * Replaced assert statements in structure editor by proper handling
   of non-existing editors. 
 * Replaced some assert statements in editor-manager too.
 * All buttons in editors are now handled via the button-language.
   The text-editor knows nothing about the details of buttons anymore.
 * Button names are now list of strings. For example: ["Action","Parse"].
   This will add the "Parse" button to the menu "Action".
   Note that all button scripts will have to be adapted to deal with this.
 * The button language was changed. All actions that had a modulename
   as a direct argument now read it from the stack as a string.
 * Added a new primitive to the button language: 'push-modulename' that
   pushed the modulename of the current editor onto the stack
 * The standard Meta-Environment buttons are now completely externalized
   from the configuration-manager. A file called 'standard.buttons' is
   installed and the configuration-manager reads it in when the 
   Meta-Environment starts up.
 * Used ApiGen to reimplement configuration manager

2003/04/25 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Refactored button-actions to use StackPush/Pop operations
 * Fixed a bug in the structure editor, ViewTree on the root of a term
   caused a core dump.
 * Completely refactored editor managing scripts. All code duplication
   removed. Editor killing simplified (must be tested thoroughly!)

2003/04/24 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * All scripts related to the implementation of the button language
   are now located in a single button-actions.tb script. This script needs
   more refactoring

2003/04/24 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * ViewTree added and Meta-Environment renamed to Term-Actions.

2003/04/16 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Reintroduced the save and print entries in the module menu.

2003/04/15 (markvdb@cs.vu.nl)
 * Repaired a very annoying bug wrt setting of foci. The message
   move-focus-to-root responded with "set-focus" which causes
   quite some interference.

2003/03/30 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Used backquotes to delay calling *-config scripts to after
   configure phase. Otherwise autobundle can't configure all packages
   before building them.

2003/03/28 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added dependency on new graph-support package
 * Added capability of drawing diamonds and ellipses to MetaStudio graph
   panels

2003/03/25 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Restructured the killing of editors, a new process introduced.
   A number of small bugs are solved in this way. There is still
   one major issue with respect reusing an existing term-editor.

2003/03/24 ({markvdb, iversen}@cwi.nl)
 * Added button-action show-area, which takes a modulename as 
   argument and an 
  aterm containing position info from the stack, and then highlights the 
  position, using the module to parse the file containing the position. 

* Also added position-info annotation to all terms.

* Removed button-action add-pos-info.

2003/03/20 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Added a "Delete this module" for a non-existing module, this
   omission was reported by PDM.

2003/03/20 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Removed dependency on shared-objects and jjtraveler. This is taken care
   of by aterm-java-config from now on.

2003/03/19 (markvdb@cs.vu.nl)
 * Reduce-button adapted to the new button actions.

2003/03/19 ({iversen, jurgenv}@cwi.nl)
 * added command add-pos-info to button-language.

   add-pos-info: Annotate parse-tree on stack with position info.

2003/03/18 ({iversen,markvdb}@cwi.nl
 * Added 2 new button actions.

2003/03/18 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Use shared-objects-config and aterm-java-config scripts to obtain last
   version of their jar files in configure.in

Mon Mar 17 14:18:19 CET 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * more aterm (jjtraveler) dependency issues fixed

2003/03/13 (vandenbr@loria.fr)
 * Introduced standalone editors for syntax, equations, and terms.
 * Introduced the notion of "application-status".
 * snd-msg(delete-editor(...)) replaced by snd-note(...).
 * Activation of term-editors explicitly acknownledged.

Tue Mar  4 09:51:15 CET 2003 <{markvdb,jong}@cwi.nl>
 * add new queries:
   - find Sdf definition of production used in Asf equation
   - find Sdf definition of variable used in Asf equation
   - find equation(s) that "implement" an Sdf production 

Thu Feb 27 09:24:54 CET 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * meta-studio: move NodeSizer.java from metastudio.graph to metastudio
   as it is not part of the generated graph package.
 * fix: profane usage of literal constants 0, 1, and 2 into symbolic
   constants (JOptionPane.YES_OPTION etc.) in handling of Dialogs.

Wed Feb 26 10:38:59 CET 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * MetaStudio.java: cleanup in file actions. Improved consistency,
   added missing default-properties, refactored fileBrowser code,
   introduced "refactor" popup submenu, and some misc. improvements.
 * edit-syntax.tb: remove set-focus that unconditionally tries to set
   the focus on the entire file. This interferes with tools (e.g. the
   query tool) that need to set the focus on a different portion of
   the term.
 * query-tool: some work done to simplify the findProduction code.
   Instead of two almost identical copies, we now have one iteration
   function which takes a predicate to do the actual (deep) comparison.
 * query-tool.tb: send query("FindProduction",..) not "FindSortDefinition"
   when asked to find a production.

Tue Feb 25 13:27:30 CET 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * refactoring: ApiGen generated sources only in metastudio.graph now
 * cleanup: use ApiGen generated (auto)make support

2003/02/18 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Activated ViewTree button.

Mon Feb 17 10:00:23 CET 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * text-editor.idef: fix rec-event for Queries acknowledged a Move event

 * Several patches to fix "make distcheck"

2003/02/12 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Added ModuleName to postprocess-collected-semantics-hook

Wed Feb 12 14:35:50 CET 2003 <olivierp@cwi.nl>
 * Fixed 'hang' bug in gui.
 * Node order is no longer changed when deleting nodes.

2003/02/11 <markvdb@cwi.nl>

 * cleaned up tbscripts/Makefile.am

Wed Feb  5 13:30:47 CET 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * configure/automake stuff added for C implementation of query-tool
 * refactored query-tool directory structure into query-tool/src/{c,spec}/FILES
 * Refactoring:
   - query-tool.[ch] contains TB specifics
   - findSortDefinition.[ch] implements the one query we have so far
     (add more to QUERIES in Makefile.am as needed)
  By separating the queries from the TB related stuff we can now write
  (unit) tests for these queries, without having to invoke the MetaEnv.

2003/02/05 (markvdb@cs.vu.nl)
 * New message/function "close-module" which deals with "deleting"
   a module without removing from the imports in depending modules.

Wed Jan 29 10:15:44 CET 2003 <{jong,markvdb}@cwi.nl>
 * First "meta-query" experiment:
   given a focus in text-editor, find the "first" Module that has
   the focus-sort as rhs in a production

2003/01/28 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Release 0.12beta
 * The error message in the equation and syntax editor was
   lost due to a resetting of the focus.

Fri Jan 24 10:09:13 CET 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * add ${top_srcdir}/meta-studio to CLASSPATH during java compilation
   to satisfy distcheck needs

2003/01/23 <{jong,jurgenv}@cwi.nl>
 * Release 0.11
 * LGPL license
 * MetaStudio is now the default GUI, manual hacking of configure.in
   needed to re-enable the "old" graph-browser
 * showdot temporarily disabled including the GUI buttons.
 * removed autoconf version checks for wish and graphviz
 * added path check for java

2003/01/17 (jong@cwi.nl)
 * Removed superfluous message in text/structure editor and simplified
   detection of dirty text-editors vs. known state in structure editor

2003/01/16 (jong@cwi.nl)
 * Fixed bug in se.c: incorrect handling of amb() as parse tree.

2003/01/10 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Fixed a bug with renamings. If an imported module has
   a parameter which is also a parameter of the surrounding
   module, the renaming has to be renamed in a consistent
   way.
 * Fixed a number of error messages.

2003/01/08 (markvdb@cs.vu.nl)
 * Return full imports when asking for the equations when dealing
   with renamings.

2002/12/09 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Changed version of aterm-java and shared-objects jarfiles

2002/11/25 (vandenbr@loria.fr)

   trees.
 * Removed annotations when removing ModuleIds from the list
   of imports.

2002/11/20 (vinju@loria.fr)
 * Set versions of shared-objects and aterm-java jarfiles to 1.0
 * Refactored module-db to use Start symbols instead of pt-support API.

2002/11/20 (vandenbr@loria.fr)
 * Fixed a bug in opening a non-existing module.
 * Removed dead code.
 * Fixed a deadlock when copying and pasting.

2002/11/15 (vandenbr@loria.fr)
 * Created a separate file with parse-utilities, because the new processes
   are needed both by meta as well as eqs-dump.

2002/11/15 (markvdb@cs.vu.nl)
 * Restructuring of the scripts with respect to setting of parse tables,
   calling of sglr, processing of parse tree cq parse errors.
   Scattered code is grouped into few new small processes.

2002/11/13 (markvdb@cs.vu.nl)

   have been added to the repository
 * Added dependency on aterm-java package

2002/10/12 (vinju@loria.fr)
 * Added Close Module to the Meta-Environment interface. You can close
   modules that are not imported by other modules. It also asks if you
   want to close imported modules recursively. Only the modules that are
   not used by other modules will be closed in that case.

2002/10/11 (vinju@loria.fr)
 * Added functionality for non-existing modules in MetaStudio. If you click
   on them you can create them by choosing the option from the menu.
 * Fixed renaming of modules, old module was not removed
 * Fixed deleting of modules, module was not really deleted
 * Module that import a deleted module are now updated to not have the 
   import any more

2002/10/10 (vinju@loria.fr)
 * Changed functionality concerning ambiguities in the editor. If you click 
   inside a cluster, the focus is set around the entire cluster 
   (to easily identify ambiguities).
 * Added Copy Module to Meta-Environment interface
 * Added Import Module to Meta-Environment interface

2002/10/09 (vinju@loria.fr)
 * Major refactoring of ToolBus scripts: 
     - All ASF specific scripts are removed and put into the asf package.
     - Toplevel meta script calls 'Meta-Interface' instead of all asf related
       processes
     - All asf related messages are replaced by generic 'hook' messages that 
       ALL must be implemented by the 'Meta-Interface' process. 
 * Added ability of setting a configuration option at runtime to MetaStudio
 * Added configuration option for term extension to MetaStudio
 * Graph-browser/MetaStudio are initialized with file extensions at run-time:
     - using the generic 'hook' messages
 * Meta script, eqs-dump script and pt-dump script are replaced by 
   a single script called 'generic-meta'. Generic-meta:
    - Takes additional -I options to extend the ToolBus include path
    - Can dump equations (-E) or a parsetable (-P) and save (-S) intermediate
      results
    - Contains no reference to ASF related tools anymore.
    - is called by a 'meta' script in the asf package which sets the correct
      -I paths.
 * dependencies on asf, asf-support and asc-support packages removed:
    - the asf package is now dependent on the meta package instead of vice
      versa.
   
2002/10/08 (vinju@loria.fr)
 * Refactored functionality to get a list of equations from the moduledb.

2002/10/03 (vandenbr@loria.fr)

 * Hardwired file extensions removed.
 
2002/09/27 (markvdb@cs.vu.nl)
 * ModuleDB is asf-support independent.
 * Scripts and code are more robust.

2002/09/26 (markvdb@cs.vu.nl)
 * First step in refactoring the code of the module-database with
   respect to renaming and parameterization.
 * Moved the renaming and parameterization functionality for equations
   to the asf directory.

2002/09/25 (markvdb@cs.vu.nl)
 * Fixed a bug in the parameter handling.
 * '-m' option added to meta script in order to enable the user to give
   the desired top-module on the command line when starting the 
   Meta-Environment.

2002/09/24 (markvdb@cs.vu.nl)
 * Introduced the -S option to eqs-dumper and pt-dumper
   in order to be enable the saving of intermediate files.

2002/09/16 (vandenbr@loria.fr)
 * Introduced the notion of "status-changed" in the editors
   to know that a term has become dirty.

      .eqs     -> .asf
      .asf.baf -> .eqs
