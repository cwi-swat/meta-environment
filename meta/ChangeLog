  * relaxed the version checking of wish. If the script is unable to
    check the version of wish, it generates a warning banner. After that
    it assumes the right version is available in the environment.
  * changed the .eqs extension to .asf. The following extensions change:
      .eqs     -> .asf
      .asf.baf -> .eqs
      .eqs.baf -> .asf.baf
      .eqs.tbl -> .asf.tbl

2001/02/14 (jong@cwi.nl)
  * version 0.2
  * frozen release after internal CWI-repository move
  * this release is much smaller than previous releases because several
    components are now distributed separately:
    - sglr
    - pgen
    - asfix (is now split into pt-support, sdf-support, asf-support)
    - evaluator

     text-editors and ToolBus-processes are removed.

2000/7/5 (jong@cwi.nl)
  * Revamped editors' directory structure.
