 * Added support for lexicals and layout to sdf2-to-adt. They are no longer
   user defined 'bottom-sorts' in a generated SDF2 api. Instead there is
   a bottom sort CHARLIST, which is instantiated by a template
 * Added a script sdf2-to-java that wraps sdf2-to-adt and adt-to-java and
   the generation of a special class (the bottom-sort CHARLIST).
 * Bumped to 1.4beta

2002/10/07 (vinju@loria.fr)
 * Changed the name of the field that gets the tree out of the start pattern.
   The name is now 'top-<type>' to disambiguate in case of multiple start
   sorts
   
2002/10/03 (vinju@loria.fr)
 * Added generation of patterns based on start symbols. For every start
   symbol the pattern parsetree(appl(prod( ... ),..) etc. is generated in
   order to hide the details of AsFix completely when using an API.
 * Bumped to 1.4beta

2002/09/31 (vinju@loria.fr)
 * Started new package sdf-apigen that contains the mapping from
   SDF to ADT.
 * Generating sdf-to-adt script using Makefile instead of configure.in
 * Release 1.3
