Mon May  3 18:02:19 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Added rudimentary support for productions that return a parameterized
   sort. Only parameterized sorts with a single argument are allowed!

Mon Apr 26 19:05:02 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Removed dependency on asf package. It was no longer used! 

Sat Apr 17 11:19:32 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Fixed automake-1.7.9 issues (similarly to the way they were fixed 
   in the apigen package). All problems located in the test directory. 
 * Regenerated C code of specifications to get wrid of ununused variable
   warnings

2003/02/11 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added dependency on toolbuslib

2003/01/22 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added dependency on error-support
 * Upgraded dependencies (without looking if that's really needed) to 
    latests unreleased versions of all packages.

2003/12/15 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * renamed ws-after-first to ws-after-head
 * removed char *sep field when the separator is fixed
 * Not String, but StrCon leads to a <str> in an imploded ADT

2003/12/15 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * CHARLIST sort is not used anymore in generated APIs! Instead, 
   for each lexical and the OptLayout sort, field are made of type <chars>.
   This leads to an interface that uses directly 'char*' or String in C
   and Java, but builds an ATermList of the ASCII characters.
   For example: makeOptLayoutPresent(" "), will make a layout parse tree
   containing somewhere a singleton [32].
 * Generation of bottom-sorts removed accordingly
 * Shell scripts simplified

2003/12/08 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Removed generation of mapping from strings to CHARLIST pending a new
   solution.
 * Added generation of list(CHARLIST, int) as the new bottom sort of
   AsFix2ME ADTs.
 * All specifications build on to of SDF2 syntax from asf-library.
 * Removed inclusion of Character-Class normalization in Sdf2-To-AsFix2ME
   because I could not figure out why it was necessary.

2003/12/04 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Sdf2-To-Imploded-ADT adapted such that fields of the type "NatCon"
   and "String" (from asf-library/basic) are translated to holes of
   type <int> and <str> respectively.

2003/12/02 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Brought up-to-date with commandline options of version 1.8 of apigen
 * Changed CHARLIST_String to charlist.Chars in Java and in C
   CHARLISTString has become CHARLISTChars. This was inevitable due
   to the renaming of CHARLIST_String to charlist.String which is not
   allowed in Java.
 * Bumped to version 2.0

2003/11/20 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * added support for parameterized modules. If a module is parameterized
   and the parameterized sort is used in the left-hand side of a production
   the sort name becomes a field of type <str> and the tree becomes a field
   of type <term>

2003/11/09 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Made CHARLIST_String.java compatible with newest apigen code
 * Made mapping to imploded adt up-to-date with ADT-2.0 format

2003/11/07 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Made generation of ADT file compatible with apigen-1.7 (ADT format 2.0)
 * NOTE: imploded format is not yet adapted to the ADT-2.0 format!

Tue Sep  2 10:33:54 CEST 2003 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * utils/sdf2-to-java.sh.src:
   - cleaned up some prints and added 'upgrade-adt' invocation

2003/06/27 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Bumped to 1.7
 * Added package definition file

2003/06/25 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Release 1.6

2003/05/30 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Fixed errors in configure.in script
 * Set version to 1.6

2003/03/20 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Bumped to 1.6beta
 * Removed dependency on shared-objects, this is taken care of by 
   aterm-java-config from now on.

2003/01/22 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Release 1.5
 * Set versions of aterm-java and shared-objects to 1.1
 * LGPL license

2003/01/18 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Brought compiled specifications with new asc-support-main interface

2002/12/19 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Set version numbers of shared-objects and aterm-java to 1.1beta

2002/11/14 (vinju@loria.fr)
 * CHARLIST implementation brought up-to-date with latest changes in
   adt-to-java
 * Tests brought up-to-date with new CHARLIST implementation
 * Added dependencies on aterm-java and shared-objects in order to be able
   to make tests for generated java API's

2002/11/13 (vinju@loria.fr)
 * CHARLIST implementation is put in output directory instead of
   output/package

2002/11/04 (vinju@loria.fr)
 * Bumped to 1.5beta
 * CHARLIST is added to the ADT automatically
 * Only CHARLIST_String is overwritten in order to make the
   translation: " " <-> [10] at toTerm and fromTerm time.

2002/11/04 (vinju@loria.fr)
 * Added support for lexicals and layout to sdf2-to-adt. They are no longer
   user defined 'bottom-sorts' in a generated SDF2 api. Instead there is
   a bottom sort CHARLIST, which is instantiated by a template
 * Added a script sdf2-to-java that wraps sdf2-to-adt and adt-to-java and
   the generation of a special class (the bottom-sort CHARLIST).
 * Ignore reject productions when generating ADT (why was this never a problem
   before?)
 * Added a script sdf2-to-c that wraps sdf2-to-adt and adt-to-c and the
   generation of a prologue file that implements the CHARLIST bottom sort.
 * Release 1.4

2002/10/07 (vinju@loria.fr)
 * Changed the name of the field that gets the tree out of the start pattern.
   The name is now 'top-<type>' to disambiguate in case of multiple start
   sorts
   
2002/10/03 (vinju@loria.fr)
 * Added generation of patterns based on start symbols. For every start
   symbol the pattern parsetree(appl(prod( ... ),..) etc. is generated in
   order to hide the details of AsFix completely when using an API.
 * Bumped to 1.4beta

2002/09/31 (vinju@loria.fr)
 * Started new package sdf-apigen that contains the mapping from
   SDF to ADT.
 * Generating sdf-to-adt script using Makefile instead of configure.in
 * Release 1.3
