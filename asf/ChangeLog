 * semantics: regenerate APIs, fix resulting errors

Tue Jun  8 11:13:30 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Refactored implementation of traversal functions in the compiler. It

   it is parsed over it was probably a variable!
 * Bumped version to 1.9

Mon May  3 16:28:32 CEST 2004 <markvdb@cwi.nl>
* All clickable warnings and error messages have become
  clickable.
* Fixed the bugs reported by Paul and Jurgen.

Tue Apr 27 16:45:27 CEST 2004 <markvdb@cwi.nl>
* Fixed the erroneous error messages generated in case of circular
  imports, see bug 219.

Fri Apr 23 09:59:17 CEST 2004 <markvdb@cwi.nl>
 * Fixed the bug related to the specificity of empty lists
   and list variables. Added a related test.
 * Added context-free start symbol ASF-Module to generated
   equations syntax.

Mon Apr 19 16:18:50 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * compiler uses output file name instead of specification name
   to compute the binary name and the .idef and .tifs file names.

Fri Apr 16 17:26:37 CEST 2004
 * Fixed bug 267: if a default rule was entered before a
   non-default rule, it remained in front of the list of
   rules.

Wed Apr 14 14:27:07 CEST 2004 <markvdb@cwi.nl>
 * Regenerated the asfsdf-checker in order to detect CHAR sorts
   in production rules.
 * Removed a non-terminating rewriting, fixed bug 125.

Wed Apr 14 14:17:44 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Generate equation syntax for context-free start symbols too.

Wed Apr 14 11:24:34 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Fixed bugs in ASFSDF Api generator: variables names now contain
   underscores between type and postfix, labels are not used for
   variable names anymore.

Fri Mar 19 17:26:46 CET 2004 <markvdb@cwi.nl>
 * Fixed the bug reported by Jorgen Iversen and me wrt to
   atmp0010 and atmp0010, changed into atmp0_0_1_0 and
   atmp0_0_10.

Wed Apr 14 11:30:56 CEST 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Fixed bugs in ASFSDF Api generator: variables names now contain
   underscores between type and postfix, labels are not used for
   variable names anymore.

Wed Apr 14 10:54:18 CEST 2004 <m336@cwi.nl>
 * Call asc-support functions with an SGLR_ParseTable, not ATerm

Tue Mar 23 11:03:14 CET 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * upgrade wrt to new MEPT API

Wed Mar 10 12:53:13 CET 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * Use new Error API
 * Upgrade static buffer sizes from 1024 10240 so construction of
   system()'able commandlines doesn't SEGV for now.

Wed Mar 10 09:56:02 CET 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Added a new check to the asf-checker: functions that are wrapped in a 
   list on the left-hand side of a rule almost never rewrite. The reason
   is that people sometimes give the wrong return type to this function:
   it should have been a list but it is the element type of the list.

Tue Mar  2 15:42:10 CET 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * fixed a bug in the condition checker:
   id := f(id)
   was not recognized as an error because the left-hand side was processed
   first, indicating that id was indeed initialized, before the right-hand
   side was checker for uninitialized variables.

2004/02/16 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Added the top module name to the asfsdf-checker.

Wed Feb 11 15:00:11 CET 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Added a phase to asfc that removes unused variables after generating
   the C code

Tue Feb 10 15:27:49 CET 2004 <m336@cwi.nl>
 * upgrade auto* to: autoconf 2.59, automake 1.7.9, libtool 1.5.2


Mon Feb  9 11:39:22 CET 2004 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Added a prototype compiler from muASF to TOM+Java currently supporting
   only the following ASF features:
     - simple rewrite equations
     - default equations
 * Finished the asf-api specification; a generator for getters and setters
   and identification predicates in ASF+SDF. The input of the specification
   is an SDF-module, the output is a shadow SDF module with the same 
   parameters that implements getters and setters for all productions that
   have cons and label attributes.

2003/07/01 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * In the compiler, the asf2muasf phase now adds the result type of every 
   function as an attribute to the funcdef in the signature. 
 * The compiler provides the types of the result of a builtin to
   every call to a builtin and so does the interpreter.

Mon Feb  2 16:43:59 CET 2004 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * fix Makefile.am to get "distcheck" working

2003/01/29 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Introduced the error support in the AsfSdfChecker.

2003/01/07 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Set version to 1.8
 * Link all compiled specifications against -lErrorAPI because asc-support
   needs that

2003/12/23 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * added dependency on error-support

Mon Dec  8 15:11:54 CET 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * syntax/asfsdf-checker/spec/*.asf: upgraded condition syntax

Thu Dec  4 15:33:42 CET 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * semantics/asf-upgrade/.cvsignore added
 * syntax/asfsdf-checker/src/AsfSdf-Checker.c regenerated

2003/11/21 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added dependency on sglr package because a new builtin uses libsglr

2003/11/10 ({markvdb,jurgenv}@cwi.nl)
 * Fixed a subtle bug in the implementation of := and !:= conditions
   in asfe. The interpreter did a lot of extra work for nothing.

2003/11/09 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added implementation of "!:=" to the asfc compiler. For each negative
   match a new function is generated. The arguments of the function are
   the current variables in the context of the condition. The function
   returns either matchfailed or matchsucceeded. The original condition 
   is then replaced by an equality condition between matchfailed and a call
   to the newly generated function.
 * Upgraded condition syntax in the compiler specification
 * An ASF file is now an ASF-Module which consists of a list of ASF-Sections.
   An ASF-Section is either an equations sections or a tests sections for now.
 * Synchronized the three version of the ASF syntax, the one in
   Add-Eqs-Syntax, the one in asf-support/lib/Asf.label.def and the one
   in the asf-library
 * Updated asfoperations tool to be able to extract a list of equations or
   a list of tests from the new ASF module syntax
 * Regenerated Add-Eqs-Syntax to deal with the new ASF module syntax
 * Updated asfchecker and asfupgrader to deal with the new syntax
 * Simplified the detection and forwarding of builtin functions in asfe. This
   was possible because the ASFAPI functionality dissapppeared earlier.

2003/11/06 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added "!:=" the condition operator that fails if a match succeeds and
   succeeds when a match fails.
 * Added implementation of "!:=" to the interpreter
 * Added checking of "!:=" operator to asf-checker. The variables that
   are used in the left-hand side of this operator are not instantiated
   so they may not be used afterwards by the other conditions or the
   right-hand side.
 * Removed addapisyntax functionality because it is never used. It should
   be replaced in the future by a specification generator that takes
   an annotated SDF2 definition and generates an ASF module with some
   setters and getters etc.

2003/11/05 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added asfupgrader, a tool that upgrades the old condition syntax 
   automatically to the new syntax.

2003/11/04 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added two new condition syntaxes: "==" equality and ":=" match.
   They are each translated to "=" now before interpreting or compiling. 
 * The asfchecker gives much more informative error messages when either of 
   the new condition syntaxes is used. 
 * In the future, the old "=" syntax will dissappear such that the code
   of the interpreter and the compiler can be simplified (and optimized).

2003/10/17 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Added a message on deprecated unquoted literals.
 * Added a message on usage of non Sort symbols in
   right hand side of lexical functions.
 * Adapted the asf-checker in order to check the newly introduced tests.

2003/10/17 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added syntax for writing positive and negative tests to ASF
 * Added test-runner and test-runner interface to asfe
 * Added conditional tests

2003/10/09 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Added a check on ASF sorts.

2003/10/09 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Results from calls to builtin functions are always normalized before
   continuing. 

2003/10/07 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Adapted to new tuples.

2003/10/06 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Extended asfc compiler to support calls to builtin functions. For each
   builtin function that is used in the equations an equation is generated
   that calls ASC_<builtin-name> function with the proper arguments.
 * Regenerated the compiler with the new code
 * Added implementations of all builtins for compiled specifications.
   Note that pos-info does not work because annotations are lost during the
   conversion from AsFix to muASF terms.
 * Removed toolbus communication builtins and support for these builtins
   from asfe.idef

2003/10/03 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Removed the set and perm symbol in the library.

2003/10/03 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Fixed some tests by retrieving the original specification and regenerating
   the .eqs files and sometimes the input and output term files. The reasons
   for failing were:
     - the AsFix representation of the terms was out-of-date
     - the eqs file were regenerated from the specification, but the 
       specification was changed by accident somehow somewhere in the past

2003/10/02 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Added ASF prefix to all sorts in the equations syntax.
 * Constructor information is no longer suppressed.
 * Regenerated AddEqsSyntax based on this new convention.
 * Regenerated all *eqs files in the test directory.

2003/10/01 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Removed a number of warning generated by the asfsdfchecker.
 * Regenerated the asfsdf-checker.

2003/10/01 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Added the imports of a number of specifications in order
   to be compatible with the new library.
 * Regenerated a number of C sources.

2003/09/25 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Added a check to the asf-checker to check that the outermost
   function symbol of the left hand side of an equation is
   *NOT* a constructor.

2003/09/22 ({storm,jurgenv}@cwi.nl)
 * Changed implementation of ordering builtin to use a stable complete
   ordering.
 * Added Measure.sdf to generation of builtin term api.

2003/09/22 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added lifting to PT_Trees and ATerms to builtin library
 * Added generic unparser to Bytes to builtin library

2003/09/20 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * The asf-builtins library now contains a generated API from a selected
   number of modules in the asf-library package. Currently, only
   basic/Booleans is included. Modules can be added by editing a 
   make variable (after adding cons and label attributes in the SDF module).

2003/09/19 ({paulk,jurgenv}@cwi.nl)
 * Added very unsafe term comparison builtin to ASF. It's unsafe because
   it does not take LAYOUT and annotations into account. Obviously,
   we have a TODO.

2003/09/16 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Moved ASF+SDF library to new asf-library package

Tue Sep 16 15:19:19 CEST 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * asf/library/sandbox/toolbus:
   - add extraction rules to find tool definitions
   - refine query to find unmatched sends 

Tue Sep  2 11:22:39 CEST 2003 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * configure.in: bump to 1.7.2
 * semantics/asfc/src/asfc.c:
   - fix bug in deriving basename from "equations.eqs": the first '.'
     was used to find the extension, but this fails horribly if instead
     of 'equations.eqs" you feed it "../../path/to/equations.eqs".
     Introduced function 'basename' to properly derive basename.
   - patch basename function to also strip directory-prefix, if present.

2003/08/31 ({jong,jurgenv}@cwi.nl)
 * Set version to 1.7.1

2003/07/29 ({jurgenv,markvdb}@cwi.nl)
 * made RWsetError type-safe (it called PT_yieldTree on an ATerm, now
   it is always a PT_Tree)
 * Fixed a serious of by 10 error (wrote an error message into a buffer that
   was too small) 

2003/07/24 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Added lexical restrictions on ModuleWord and ModuleId.
 * Added a warning when literals are detected in the right hand side
   of productions rules.

2003/07/16 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Fixed a bug in asfc, it could not deal with ATermLists in terms stored
   in attributes of productions.

 * Removed "Id := process-id" in idef-generation

2003/06/11 (markvdb@cs.vu.nl)
 * Fixed a bug report by Ernst-Jan Verhoeven. Double star list
   variables resulted in wrong C code.

2003/05/19 ({jong,markvdb}@cwi.nl)
 * Added explicit ATBpack and ATBunpack.

2003/05/07 ({markvdb,jong}@cwi.nl)
 * Improved the AsfSdfChecker wrt error messages in combination with
   traversal functions.

2003/04/29 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Fixed the annoying bug wrt unnecessary warnings in case of parameters.
 
2003/02/14 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Fixed a minor bug in asf-operations, renaming in modules that have no 
   "equations" keyword failed and resulted in an abort.

2003/04/01 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Set no longer re-use the List module. 
 * Square brackets are replaced by curly brackets.

2003/03/31 (markvdb@cwi.nl)

 * Fix some #include issues with strlen/strcmp

2003/02/18 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * The files of the installed ASF+SDF library are no longer write-protected
   either. A different solution must be found to make these files read-only
   when opening them in the Meta-Environment.

2003/02/13 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * The directories of the installed ASF+SDF library are no longer
   write-protected automatically.
 * ASF extended with new builtins that can generate ToolBus events from
   within a specification. This can be used to connect other tools to
   a specification or to let a specification influence the Meta-Environment 
   at run-time. For example: tb-snd-note(ATerm) sends a note into the
   ToolBus.
   
2003/02/12 (markvdb@cs.vu.nl)
 * Improved the asfchecker with respect to ambiguities.

2003/02/11 ({jong,markvdb})@cwi.nl)
 * Bumped into 1.7beta.
 * Added \r as character in quoted literals.
 * Improved AlphaNumericalEscChar.

2003/01/22 ({jong,jurgenv}@cwi.nl)
 * ToolBus support /required/ not /optional/ !!

2003/01/22 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Release 1.6

2003/01/09 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added asfix syntax to library

2002/10/31 (vandenbr@loria.fr)
 * simplified the code with respect to storing equations. In fact, this
   functionality has been complete removed.

2002/10/29 (vinju@loria.fr)
 * Made asf package independent of ToolBus tools by putting tool interfaces
   in repository and removing implicit build rules for idef2tif and tifstoc

2002/10/13 (vinju@loria.fr)
 * Meta-Environment scripting is put in a separate package: asfsdf-meta
 * Put syntax related tools in syntax subdirectory and semantics related
   tools in semantics directory to create a better overview in this 
   large package.
 * Incorporated asf-library package in this package. 
 * Moved builtins code from library to semantics.
 * Asfe accepts ambiguous terms when it is connected to the Meta-Environment

2002/10/09 (vinju@loria.fr)
 * Added dependency on meta package
 * Added directory meta-scripts that contains the meta-environment ToolBus
   interface. These two scripts with the meta package together form the
   ASF+SDF Meta-Environment now.
 * Added the 'meta' script that calls the 'generic-meta' script from the meta
   package with the correct ToolBus include path.

2002/10/08 (vinju@loria.fr)
 * Refactored asf-operations tool

2002/09/27 ({vinju,moreau}@loria.fr)
 * Moved generic symbol renaming functionality to pt-support

2002/09/27 (markvdb@cs.vu.nl)   
 * Added an operation to obtain the list of equations given a
   parse tree of the equations.

2002/09/26 (markvdb@cs.vu.nl)   
 * Moved the renaming and parameterization functionality for equations
   to the asf directory.

2002/09/09 (vandenbr@loria.fr)
 * Added "#!/bin/sh" to generated test scripts in order to make
   them work on CYGWIN.
   
2002/07/30 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Bumped to 1.6beta

 * Release 1.5

2002/07/16 (vandenbr@loria.fr, jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Fixed a bug in the asf interpreter concerning functions that return 
   lists but are not normalized to lists always.

2002/07/01 (vandenbr@loria.fr)
 * Lexical and ambiguity constructor explicitly added to the
   corresponding productions.

2002/06/27 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Simplified (list) matching and condition checking algorithms in asfe.

2002/06/26 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)

 * Removed 'instantiated and uninstantiated variables' error message.

2002/06/26 (vandenbr@loria.fr)
 * Fixed a number of small bugs.

2002/06/24 (vandenbr@loria.fr)

   names.

2002/06/05 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Made concat-asf robust against empty input files

2002/06/05 (vandenbr@loria.fr)
 * Bug fix wrt. more than one list pattern in a list pattern.

2002/06/03 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Two new traversal directives added (interpreter only): 
   break and continue. A traversal function either breaks of traversal on
   the current branch after a successful application of a rewrite rule, 
   or continues traversing.

2002/05/31 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added the notion of failure to the rewriting process in asfe. 
   Every rewrite step/traversal/built-in can return FAIL instead of a reduct. 
   Depending on the context different actions can now be activated for FAIL 
   and success. This can be used for experimenting with different traversal
   strategies.
 * Bumped version of asfe to 0.6

2002/05/22 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Fixed dependency bug on asf-library in configure.in

2002/05/22 (vandenbr@loria.fr)
 * Based the specifications of AddApiSyntax, AddEqsSyntax,
   AsfSdfChecker, RemoveVarSyntax on the Sdf version of the
   new asf-library.

2002/05/15 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Connected asfe to asf-builtins library
 * Added configure switch for asf-library (for builtins)

2002/05/14 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Fixed a bug in addeqssyntax that caused module with multiple import 
   sections to crash during parsetable generation.
   Example: "module A imports B imports C"

2002/05/13 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * The asfc compiler renames slashes to underscores in the module name
   to cope with compound module names.
 * Bumped to 1.5beta

2002/04/19 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Release 1.4

2002/04/18 (vandenbr@loria.fr)
 * addapisyntax can now deal with parameterized sorts.
 * AsfSdfChecker checks whether production renamings are used,
   if so an error message is generated:
   "production-renamings-not-supported".

2002/17/04 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Fixed a bug in traversal functions with more than 7 arguments.

2002/27/03 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Made asfc call configured c compiler and use configured c compiler flags.

2002/03/26 (vandenbr@loria.fr)
 * Added a check on the use of character classes in context-free
   syntax sections.
   
2002/03/25 (vandenbr@loria.fr)
 * Regenerated the C code of the AsfSdf-Checker, because the
   Sdf-Checker can handle incomplete specifications and
   aliases.

2002/03/22 (vandenbr@loria.fr)
 * Restructured the Sdf-Checker, partly moved to asf directory.

2002/13/03 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)

   like: f("t" | "f") -> F in some cases.
 * Bumped asfc to 2.5

2002/03/04 (vandenbr@loria.fr)
 * Introduced parameterized sorts.

2002/02/27 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Fixed a bug in the is-<cons> builtin. If it returned false it would
   match correclty in the conditions.
 * Bumped to 1.4beta
 * Removed automatic predicate generation for prefix functions without
   a cons annotation.

2002/02/13 ({jurgenv,markvdb}@cwi.nl)
 * Released 1.3
 * Fixed memory leak in restore-brackets

2002/02/12 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Fixed a serious bug in the asf compiler. It couldn't handle lists
   at the top of matching conditions.
 * Set version of asfc to 2.4

2002/02/05 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Bumped to version 1.3

 * Improved usage message of concat-asf
 * Pos-info is no longer needed for asfe if debugging with Tide is 
   not activated.

2002/01/23 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Fixed a bug in addapisyntax; sequences were not supported.

2002/01/22 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Changed addapisyntax a bit after suggestions of P. Mosses. 
   1. You can use labels without a cons now.
   2. Added support for prefix functions. No constructor is generated
      but there is a predicate (is-<function-name>).

2002/01/16 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added '-m' switch to asfe. If this switch is given the interpreter marks
   all new layout (introduced by the equations) such that a (partial)
   pretty-printer can take care of it.
 * Bumped version of asfe to 0.5.

2002/01/15 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added a tool addapisyntax that add syntax based on cons attributes
   and labels. A cons attribute generates a prefix constructor function
   and an predicate function. A label generates a getter and a setter.
 * Added semantics for generated api syntax in the interpreter.
 * Added preliminary support for ASF primitives (or builtins) using the
   "builtin(<name>)" attribute.

2002/01/08 (vandenbr@loria.fr)

 * Bumped asfc version to 2.3
 * Bumped package version to 1.2.2beta

2001/12/06 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Fixed a bug in accumulating transformers. Results of such traversal
   functions had incorrect types and could not be used in conditions.

2001/11/29 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Adapted all components to cope with new production attributes (no 
   automatic quoting anymore).
 * Adapted regression tests by hand to check the changes.

2001/11/25 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
 * package now uses toolbuslib package
 * extended functionality of program-check.m4 macros

2001/11/21 (jurgen@cwi.nl)

 * Removed unused argument from PT_applyFunctionToTree.

2001/11/12 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added a '-l' option to asfe that replaces all layout by a single space
   in the output term (used for testing compatibility with compiled
   specificatons).
 * Moved tests of asfc and asfe to shared test directory. Results for
   interpreted and compiled specifications are now checked to be equal.
 * Added a number of tests for traversal functions and sdf2 symbols.
 * Moved apply-function tool to pt-support package

2001/11/07 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Fixed a bug in the compiler. More than one rewrite rules DIRECTLY over a 
   list were not handled correctly and resulted in runtime core dumps.
 * Added support for transformers that visit a list to the compiler.
 * NOTE: transformers and accumulators are now fully supported by the
   compiler.

2001/11/06 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Traversal functions in the compiler: 
   - added support for traversal functions with a single variable as the first
     argument in a defining equation.
   - added support for accumulators that return a list symbol directly.

2001/11/06 ({jurgenv,markvdb}@cwi.nl)
 * Removed module identifiers from productions:
   - Regenerated the compiler. 
   - Regenerated the MuASF library. 
 * Changed commandline options of asfc.
   - the name of a specification is automatically computed from the name
     of the input file. This can be overridden by the -n option.
   - if input is stdin, the -n option is obligatory.
   - the standalone compiler does not call gcc by default anymore, only
     if you provide the -c option. (the ToolBus version still compiler to
     binary by default).
 
2001/11/05 ({jurgenv,markvdb}@cwi.nl)
 * Removed module identifiers from productions:
   - Re-generated Add-Eqs-Syntax.c
   - Re-generated Remove-Var-Syntax.c
   - Adapted apply-function tool.

2001/11/02 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)

 * RESTRICTION: accumulators that return a list sort are not supported yet.

2001/11/01 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added support for traversal functions to the compiler (transformers only).
   Bottom-up or top-down with optionally extra variables.
 * RESTRICTION: just a variable as the first argument of a traversal
   function in the left-hand side of a defining equation are NOT allowed.
 * RESTRICTION: transformers that visit lists are not supported yet.

2001/10/25 (jurgenv@cwi.nl, markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Optimized evaluator. Lexical constructor functions are now imploded
   to real lexical trees.

2001/10/11 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
 * Added (generated) manual pages to EXTRA_DIST variable because not
   everybody has pod2man available

2001/10/01 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Refactored the rewriting code in the ASF interpreter. Divided the
   innermost rewriting function into smaller subfunctions.
 * Refactored the code for the traversal functions in the ASF interpreter.
   The interpreter now supports the following traversal attributes:
     - traversal(trafo,bottom-up), 
     - traversal(accu,bottom-up), 
     - traversal(trafo,accu,bottom-up), 
     - traversal(trafo,top-down), 
     - traversal(accu,top-down), 
     - traversal(trafo,accu,top-down) 
 * For backward compatibility the "traverse" attribute is still supported.

2001/09/27 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Made some important changes in the Sdf grammar:
     - added:   ATerm                      -> Attribute 
     - removed: "cons" "(" term:ATerm ")"  -> Attribute 
                "constructor"              -> Attribute 
                "memo"                     -> Attribute 
                "traverse"                 -> Attribute 
     - refactored the ATerm grammar a bit
 * NOTE: These changes affect any specification that imports the SDF 
         grammar.
 * Adapted compiler frontend to cope with new AsFix attribute format.
 * Changed regression tests terms of asfc and asfe to new AsFix attribute
   format.

 * Added include directives for ToolBus in filtereqssyntax

2001/08/08 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added a new tool: filtereqssyntax that disambiguates ASF equations
   and condition by choosing the least number of injections in the
   left-hand-side. In time, this filter can replace the generic injection 
   count filter in sglr.

2001/08/07 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
 * asfc/src/c-code.c: Changed -DMAIN_<module-name> to -DASF_MAIN

2001/07/20 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added rewriting of ambiguity clusters; addeqssyntax generates
   "amb({Symbol ","}+) -> Symbol" and asfe lifts ambiguity clusters
   to this syntax before rewriting and flattens them back when finished.
 * Fixed asfc such that modules with no equation compile to a binary
   that does nothing but building a normal form.
 * Set version of asfe to 0.3.
 * Set version of addeqssyntax to 2.1

2001/07/19 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
