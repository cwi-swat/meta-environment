2001/07/18 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Fixed optimization of recursive list functions. In combination
   with automatic constructor detection, a large speedup can be
   expected.
 * asfc version to 2.1

2001/07/17 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * Added automatic constructor detection to asfc

2001/07/17 (jong@cwi.nl)
 * version 1.0 released, bumped to 1.1

2001/07/16 (jong@cwi.nl)
 * documented bump to version 1.0

2001/07/12 (jong@cwi.nl)
  * patched Makefile.am's to comply with new location of -lATB

2001/07/10 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Added support for rewrite rules with a list as outermost function
    to asfc

2001/07/09 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * started new collection of regression tests for asfc

2001/07/06 (jurgenv@cwi.nl, markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * version now 1.0
  * Removed C code generated by old compiler from RemoveVarSyntax.
  * Removed C code generated by old compiler from AddEqsSyntax.
  * Added C code generated by new compiler.

2001/07/04 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Replaced asfix2muasf frontend by a new frontend, written in C: asf2muasf
  * Removed reshuffling from the compiler
  * Slightly altered the backend, muasf2c to be able to handle asfix2me muasf.
  * Changed the interface of asfc to read in a .eqs file and print out C code.
  * Bootstrapped the compiler to obtain an AsFix2ME compliant asf compiler.
  * See also: asc-support package

2001/07/04 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Removed a bug from the evaluator, which was there all the time,
    nested sublist were not treated correctly!

2001/06/18 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * Fixed a compiler bug. Coming back from an optimized recursive
    function, checking of the expected function symbols was not done at all.

2001/06/15 ({jurgenv,olivierp}@cwi.nl)
  * Fixed bug in rewriting with layout
  * Changed TB interface to completely functional approach

2001/06/15 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * adapted apply-function in order to be AsFix2ME compatible.

2001/05/31 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * changed extension .eqs to .asf in compiler specification

2001/05/30 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Fixed a "bug" in addeqssyntax with respect to prefix functions.
  * Regenerated C code for Remove-Var-Syntax and Add-Eqs-Syntax.

2001/05/23 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Released version 0.2, and bumped into 0.3.  
  * Bumped into version 0.2 in order to make distribution. 

2001/05/04 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * asc-support.h replaced by asc-support2.h in order to make
    recompilation of generated code independent of changes in
    libMEPT.

2001/04/27 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
  * Adapted asfe to support AsFix2ME to its full extent.

2001/03/23 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * added concat-asf, a tool that reads in parse trees of .asf files and
    dumps their equations concatenated in a single list of equations.

2001/03/08 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * addeqssyntax and removevarsyntax based on PT and SDF libraries

2001/03/02 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * asfe keeps all ATerm annotations during rewriting
  * added one term for Pico-typecheck to test which contains pos-info

2001/02/22 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * all ATerm annotations are removed from both equations and term 
    before asfe begins rewriting

2001/02/20 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * asfe now based on ASF and PT support libraries
  * asfe can now only rewrite WITH layout

2001/02/6 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * evaluator is renamed to asfe
  * compiler is renamed to asfc

2001/02/5 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
  * asf contains the following components, which are inherited from
    the deprecated new-meta package: compiler, evaluator, addeqssyntax
    removevarsyntax, genmakefile, genamakefile
