ASF rewriting engines

This package contains the implementation of the rewriting language ASF. ASF
rewrites terms in user-defined syntax.

The following tools are provided: 

addeqssyntax    - add ASF syntax to the user-defined term syntax for parsing                       equations. 
removevarsyntax - removes variables syntax to obtain efficient parsetables for 
                  parsing closed terms.
asfe            - an interpreter for ASF specifications.
asfc            - a compiler for ASF specifications to C programs.
genmakefile     - a tool that generates Makefiles or Makefile.in's for compiled 
                  specifications.
genamakefile    - a tool that generates Makefile.am's for compiled 
                  specifications. 

These tools have a standalone interface that read and writes from files, but
addeqssyntax, removevarsyntax, asfe and asfc also have a ToolBus interface.
	    
Installation Instructions
=========================

1) Required packages.

   The ASF rewriting engines requires the following packages:

   -GNU make, available from:
       www.gnu.org

   -The ATerm library, available from:
       www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/

   -The pt-support library, available from:
       www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/

   -The sdf-support library, available from:
       www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/

   -The asf-support library, available from:
       www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/

   -The ASF+SDF compiler runtime library, available from:
       www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/

   Before building the ASF rewriting engines, you should first install these
   packages.

2) Configuring the ASF rewriting engines.

   Assuming that the aterm library, the support libraries and the runtime 
   library, are installed in <aterm>,  <pt-support>, <sdf-support>, 
   <asf-support>, and  <asc-support> respectively and that the ASF rewriting 
   engines should be installed in <asf> then the following command will 
   configure the rewriting engines accordingly:

   ./configure --prefix=<asf> \
               --with-aterm=<aterm> \
               --with-pt-support=<pt-support> \
               --with-sdf-support=<sdf-support> \
               --with-asf-support=<asf-support> \
               --with-asc-support=<asc-support> 

   Note. Default behaviour of configure is that it will look for libraries
         in <prefix>/lib and for executables in your search paths. So,
         you do not need to specify the locations of all these packages
         explicitly (as we did in the example above).

   Note. The extra configuration flag --with-traversals activates new ASF
         functionality in the ASF evaluator, but not in the ASF compiler.
 
   If you use gcc, pgen is built with "gcc -Wall -g -O2". If you prefer
   different options use --with-cflags="<options>" when you run configure.

   ./configure --help gives a detailed list of configuration options.       

3) Building the ASF rewriting engines.

   Assuming that GNU make is called "gmake" on your system then the
   following commands will build and install the ASF rewriting engines:

   gmake
   gmake install

4) Checking the ASF rewriting engines.

   The ASF rewriting engines can be tested via:

   gmake check

5) Bug reporting and support.

   Please report bugs via:

   http://www.cwi.nl/htbin/MetaEnv/meta-bugs

   This is the general bug reporting page of the ASF rewriting engines.

   Support can be obtained via:

   meta-support@cwi.nl

6) Known bugs.

   None.
