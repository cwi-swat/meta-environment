=head1 NAME

REMOVEVARSYNTAX - Adds the "equation" syntax to an SDF definition

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<removevarsyntax> [-B<h>] [-B<m> I<module>] [-B<i> I<file>] [-B<o> I<file>] [-B<vV>] file0 ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<removevarsyntax> removes the variable definition from a parsed (AsFix1) SDF2 syntax definition.

A number of options can be supplied; these are as follows:

=over 4

=item -B<h>

Displays concise usage information.

=item -B<m> I<module>

Top module of the specification.

=item -B<i> I<file>

Read input from F<file>; by default, input is either read from stdin,
or from the named files supplied as arguments.

=item -B<o> I<file>

Write output to F<file>.  By default, output is written to file with a
name derived from the name of the input file for named files, and to
standard output on input from standard input.

=item B<-v>

Operate in verbose mode.

=item B[-V]

Returns the current version number.

=head1 NOTES

Expected input for removevarsyntax is a full, flattened, parsed SDF2 
specification in a single AsFix1-file.  In such a file, all modules 
for the language defined are present; each module is identified 
by "module <ModuleName>", and at the top the keyword "definition" 
identifies the consecutive list of modules as a full SDF2 specification.
