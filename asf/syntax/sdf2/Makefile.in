# The SDF2 parser generator contains an SDF2 grammar and parse table. To
# prevent possible conflicts with other grammars, the parser generator
# installs the SDF2 grammar and parse table in <prefix>/share/pgen. We
# install both also in <prefix>/share because the grammar is used as
# standard SDF2 grammar within the ASF+SDF Meta-Environment.
