Corba IDL compiler
------------------
- Generated code is not meant to be readable (and is unreadable)
- Distributed approach
- Well-defined mappings to specific target languages (whitepapers)
- Only getters/setters
- Corba specific functionality
- Interface centric instead of datatype centric
- No date type

Aspect-J
--------
- aspects are meant to express cross-type concerns while autocode
  is meant to express type-full concerns
- aspect weaving can be performed after autocode code generation
  because generated code is well-understood.
- aspect-j is Java only
- in autocode the generators can implement some cross-type
  concerns (profiling, tracing, etc).
